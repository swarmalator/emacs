Just read an article on [[https://medium.com/personal-growth/it-leaks-its-analog-and-i-love-it-e2b4c3e6f33b][medium.com]] that talked about fountain pens and how writing is a good thing to do sometimes as opposed to typing. I have thought about this before but am wondering again if I should have some sort of journal going in writing as well as typing. Not sure, but I am still convinced that typing has a considerable advantage in the practicality department. Journaling by typing not only gets thoughts down quicker than writing, but it helps me to practice doing the thing that I will need to do in most other situations of communicating in my life. Rarely, if ever, will I be required to write and submit something that is hand-written.
