Thinking about names for my website. Currently it is Swarmalator, though I don't think it would be too interesting of a name to the most amount of people considering that it sounds rather made-up. To those that try to get to know my via my website, the name of it will likely be the most influential part of their perception. What about ?????. Question me. Question this. Doubt this. Question it. Cole H Turner. Colestion. Questurn. coleslaw.
