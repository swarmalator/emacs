My Dad came to the place yesterday and stayed the night, he just left. Worked on the TV antenna and the old Kenmore gas grill that was in the shed. We got both working. Just also hooked up my laptop to the TV here. Currently thinking on what to do. Something science related, heh. 

I have lots of dishes to clean. Worried that if I don't sit here and find something meaningful to focus on, I might waste my time doing relatively pointless things such as washing the dishes. Not too worried, though. I've been enjoying the idea of making my own YouTube videos for a while now. I just now got my GoPro in from Austin and have pretty much everything I would need to get a decent upload - I think.

Trying to sift through my thoughts for something that is important. Was just thinking about how being out here brings a kind of satisfaction that I am familiar with after playing Minecraft, only that this is "real life". The satisfaction doesn't depend on whatever end-goal I have in mind, really, though working for the long term as well brings much more satisfaction when one is more reflective.

I like the name of the YouTube channel, "What I've Learned" - it seems that whatever channel I create would be one where I simply share whatever experience I have of things, professional or amateur. It also seems to be a great place to receive feedback, considering that it becomes popular enough for people to watch. Maybe I should make two channels, one for the technical aspects of whatever I am doing, and the other for the more philosophical or easily digestible of videos. I don't want to do any kind of daily vlog, I don't think - at least not at first.
