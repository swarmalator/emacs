I am rethinking my decision to publish all of my raw thoughts onto the site. For some reason I don't like the idea, though I can't fully explain why. Perhaps I do not want other people to know that I sometimes have pointless thoughts. But then again, I wonder who would ever even read the thoughts on there. Perhaps I will keep the page on the site but I will not advertise it as a part of the site so much.

Okay so let's see what I can work on today. Record player is playing. Could spend a good deal of time doing chores around the house. Will eventually need to do them anyways so that sounds like something I probably should get to.
