* About Me
I'm some guy.

My website is up currently. I simply used the built-in html export feature in {{{org-mode}}} and styled it with the {{{readtheorg}}} theme. Was surprisingly simple to produce, also just using {{{githubpages}}}. While reading how to set this up, I also ran into an idea that I have run into before that is quite interesting (and is something that I feel I am well aquainted with) and this is {{{literateprogramming}}}. As my website evolves I suspect that I might include various tutorials on how to setup {{{emacs}}} to publish to my website, {{{haskell}}} programming, whatever physics I run into in my research, {{{mellintransform}}}s , the {{{ism}}}, {{{pde}}}s, nonlinear methods, etc. Hopefully after spending the time to configure {{{emacs}}} and {{{org-mode}}}, I won't have to also spend so much time learning too much {{{html}}}, or how to design a website. Would be very nice to keep my focus on other things while I update the site with little extra effort necessary.

I wonder if I have mispelled necessary, just then, which reminds me that I still have not updated the "flyspell" spell-checker in {{{emacs}}} 26, though it was working fine in {{{emacs}}} 25. perhaps I should just keep with {{{emacs}}} 25 - I don't think that I should have any problems (though I haven't even looked at the changelog to see how much improved {{{emacs}}} 26 is..)

Here, I am back and in {{{emacs}}} 25.1
