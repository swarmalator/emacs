Today I have elected to turn in my english rhetorical
analysis assignment by the end of the day, though I have not actually
started writing the 1800 words and now the word wrap might keep going
I am not sure whether I want to do this or not okay this is friggin
sick! Now the word wrap goes all the way to the end of the document
and I can just keep writing what I want to write I enjoy this
immensely just kidding my thoughts are going. Must work on something
now, but what? &ldquo;By the end of the day&rdquo; would definitely suggest that I
would be turning the paper in before midnight&#x2026; but I don&rsquo;t imagine
that my professor is still awake at this time and I may as well have
uuntil the morning so I may stay up all night and get this done. The
sacred space essay I also have until 11 or so tomorrow technically to
still be able to receive an 80 on it. I had many thoughts in reading
my classmate&rsquo;s paper. I said one thing earlier that I think may have
been interpreted as an insult or narcissistic comment, about not
needing to use the writing center that TCU provides, though I hope
this was not this case. Anyways, I can begin brainstorming about the
sacred space project. Just kidding, it would be more worth my time to
focus on the rhetorical analysis paper that will analyze Dave Rubin&rsquo;s
argument style in his internet address of the Intellectual Dark
Web. The group of people and style of conversation definitely seems to
be tthe kind of deep thinking, though the word &ldquo;Intellectual&rdquo; does
also seem to bug me.
</p>

<p>
Who gets to say, really, who is an intellectual?  Is this just a
scholar? A smart person? Intelligence, I presume. I still am of the
thought that no one really known what constitutes intelligence, seeing
as we are still coming up with better ways to construct artificial
intelligence. &ldquo;If I cannot make it, then I do not understand it,&rdquo; is a
saying that comes to mind which may apply to the current situation
with regards to humans&rsquo; understanding of intelligence. I want to say
that Feynman was the one who said this, though I am also fairly
certain that the quote is not exactly the way he said it.
</p>

<p>
I have gotten side-tracked, perhaps? The rhetorical analysis, yes. Off
the top of my head, I remember Rubin coming across as quite passionate
about his viewpoint. This is alright insofar as he acknowledges that
it is not <i>the</i> viewpoint, which from his other podcasts and shows, it
seems he has done a good job. Best shown in this address, however, is
perhaps where he mentions how his political stance has changed in a
number of ways. From the left more toward the right, in his case,
generally speaking, but also toward strong defense of the principle of
free speech. Here is where I anticipate the highest amount of public
controversy. The question, &ldquo;At what point does someone&rsquo;s right to
freedom of speech trump another person&rsquo;s right not to be offended?&rdquo;
the answer to which would certainly correlate with one&rsquo;s perception of
the whole Intellectual Dark Web movement.
</p>

<p>
I think that I need to put more of my thoughts down onto my laptop, as
I am doing now. I think also that I have been a slow writer
recently. Not so sure that this is necessarily a bad thing, though I
also think that there is some truth to the idea that one does not
usually sit down with a blank document and start writing any piece in
the way that it will be when it is finished. Outlining seems to be of
great help, generalizing a topic into main categories and then into
themes or the most important ideas involved. Then, expanding each
point in a sort of tree, like fashion until the writing is at an
appropriate level of detail. This is to be contrasted with just
beginning at the final level of detail, not having any indication as
to how long the writing may end up being if the writer is to keep said
level of detail throughout all of the paper. Thus, it seems more
vulnerable to inconsistencies and possibly getting side-tracked into
irrelevant conversation. Losing sight of the big picture would be a
good way to say what I mean.
</p>

<p>
So alright, lets see what kinds of topics I will be covering. The
&ldquo;mind map&rdquo; technique as discussed in class for the op-ed might also be
a great way to structure this analysis writing. The main focus here
being the specific argument of one stakeholder, Dave Rubin. Perhaps it
is more of an attitude of &ldquo;here is this issue that I am curious about
and this person seems to have something to say about it - what is he
saying and why might I be inclined to believe him?&rdquo; This question is
hard to phrase, considering that our professor has stated on multiple
occasions that the analysis claim be about the <i>nature</i> of the stake
holder&rsquo;s argument on the issue, <b>not</b> about the issue itself. In the
simplest terms I can imagine, &ldquo;why should I listen to [stakeholder]?&rdquo;
is the question that it seems we are trying to answer. Though this is
perhaps too broad in the sense that the focus should be just on the
argument that is being made (from the specific source
mentioned). Nonetheless, I like this approach as it is very relevant
in research and forming an opinion on the issue, hearing what others
are saying and how they are saying it.
</p>

<p>
Free Speech is the largest topic Intellectual Dark Web is the subtopic
The Rubin Report is the stakeholder YouTube is the media platform /
communication medium
</p>

<p>
At what point does one&rsquo;s right to freedom of speech trump one&rsquo;s right
not to be offended?

Free Speech vs. Hate speech debate?  Wikipedia, &ldquo;fighting words&rdquo; What
is protected under the U.S. law?
</p>

<p>
While the question is a rather controversial one, this is the main
topic of my project.
</p>

<p>
A situation is which one feels that by being honest and expressing
one&rsquo;s opinion, in good faith, one may risk offending the person that
is spoken to.
</p>

<p>
I imagine the situation in which I have been born and raised in Nazi
Germany in a family and community which supports the Nazi
regime. Suppose I meet an outsider at a coffee shop and begin talking
to them about life. Suppose also that this person is Jewish, and that
I think Jewish people are evil and deserving of death based solely on
the fact that they identify as a Jew. One major thing to note here is
that, what if we also suppose that I am of the mind that <i>cares</i> whether
or not it is true that Jews are deserving of death. That is to say
that, I am a unique kind of Nazi who believes in what he has been told
insofar as this is all he has known, and that this is his best guess
as to how to act in the world. Now, (and I suppose I am changing
perspectives) if the Nazi were to tell the Jew that he thinks Jews
should die, this would surely cause a great deal of distress and
offensiveness. My question is, how would said Nazi be able to change
his mind out of some radical position if no one allows him to state
his position aloud? What if no one is there to hear his reasoning and
try to correct his errors of judgment? It seems that he would instead
be likely to face immediate retaliation with no explanation as to why
his opponents are responding in this way. Such seems tragic as
everyone involved may be doing only what he/she believes is correct,
though there should surely be no tolerance for an opinion that wishes
the death of another human. Such is to use freedom of expression to
advocate the suppression of expression of another individual. Life
seems as good an unalienable right as any, but what about freedom of
expression? What is a good policy to take when someone is using their
freedom of speech to interfere with someone else&rsquo;s freedom of speech?
&ldquo;I think that you shouldn&rsquo;t be able to say that&rdquo; is a basic way of
putting this, and it sounds an awful lot like the words of someone who
may have just been offended. It seems identical to saying &ldquo;I think
people&rsquo;s speech should not be free under the law.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
An interesting thing to point out is also that any speech is
ultimately subject to certain consequences, not just legal. If someone
wants to fire someone for posting that their boss is a bitch to
Facebook, certainly this is acceptable. For Sam Harris, who states
frequently that it is important to be able to criticize bad ideas,
what consequences should come of the opinion that Islam is the mother
load of bad ideas? This is not to say that Muslims should be killed,
of course, nothing at all about Muslims as human beings. The idea,
however, that Muhammad is the final messiah and son of God and that
the Koran contains the infallible word of god, (which indicates that
certain members of a society are deserving of death), is argued to be
one that should not be respected, perhaps? What do we mean by, I do
not like this idea. Should we get rid of the idea? Death to an idea?
Or advocation against the idea of Islam, perhaps? Being able to argue
against it publicly so as to offer reasons not to become a Muslim and
let those who read decide whether or not this is convincing? I think
yes, this is what is meant by holding an opposition to an idea. It is
only to say that &ldquo;I think there are good reasons for <i>not</i> believing in
Islam,&rdquo; for example in this situation. It is a rather harmless
statement of opinion, it seems. &ldquo;I think it is a bad idea&rdquo; turns into
&ldquo;I think I can convince you not to become a Muslim&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
I wonder if the controversy surrounding a phobia of Islam arises from
the ambiguity of being a Muslim. The Koran might explicitly instruct
believers to kill those who have turned their back on Allah, in which
case we must know what is to be interpreted by someone identifying as
Muslim? Is this equivalent to saying that one wishes death upon
nonbelievers? Perhaps a clarification need to be made on a massive
scale for the community of Muslims, thereby forcing those who wish
death to be recognized and potentially face conflicts under the law
should they not reevaluate their beliefs. Meanwhile, it should be
encouraged that the Muslim community do this, if any of what I have
said here has any correspondence with reality.
</p>

<p>
I have, of course, gone way off topic here, I&rsquo;m afraid. While my
thoughts on the idea of free speech are more clear, I must still
evaluate the argument style in Rubin&rsquo;s video. Let the all-nighter
begin.

I wonder if writing to myself, typing to myself, would be a good way
to think about what I have to get done. I have enabled flyspell in the
buffer, and then I added the global macro &ldquo;C-c s&rdquo; which will now be a
shortcut for that command.
</p>

<p>
I suppose my thoughts come down a lot faster when typing here than
they do when writing with my fountain pen. I do enjoy doing that
though! Perhaps I should make a change toward a more productive style
such as this. I like this. But is it working?
</p>

<p>
I have to do a bunch of things today, such a statement is useless to
think. I would like to get my assigned writings finished though. I
have to write an essay on the Treaty Oak tree and the sacred space
that it takes on. I have done all the research, really, I just have
trouble sitting down and writing out what I think, I guess. Should
probably update my professor on what has been going on lately, I
should do that now.

<blockquote>
<p>
Ask a scientist what he conceives the scientific method to be and he
will adopt an expression that is at once solemn and shifty-eyed:
solemn, because he feels he ought to declare an opinion; shifty-eyed,
because he is wondering how to conceal the fact that he has no opinion
to declare. &#x2013; Sir Peter Madawar
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Now that I have caught up on those emails, I suppose I should begin
thinking about how to approach this analysis paper. Or should I begin
on the Treaty Oak? I think that the maximum score that I may get on
this now has become a 60. That is, if I turn this in today. Each day
the maximum grade drops 10 points. Or, is the policy actually that it
drops 10%? The policy is that the grade is reduced by a letter grade
for each day that it is not turned in. This would mean that the grade
has gone from an A by the end of Thursday, B, C, D - an F by the end
of today. Or, if the due dates are generous I suppose it may be a D if
turned in today. Either way, I think it is always fair to turn in
something rather than nothing.

Chilling here in my hoodie. I can see the reflection of myself in the

daily instead of 10mg. The former is what I have been prescribed but
the latter is what I have been taking for probably a year or so.

I also have a lot to catch up on, some of which I am note even sure
that I will receive credit for. For whatever reason, I also end up
anticipating that my professors will have something to say, a sort of

\large The Life I Ought to Live
</p>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p>
Hi Cole,
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve been awake for quite a few hours this morning. I decided to start
watching the Netflix documentary entitled &ldquo;Minimalism&rdquo; and I am just
over half way through. My thoughts have been going crazy about some of
the things mentioned in this documentary, and I came to sort of a
self-realization: I don&rsquo;t think I am allowing myself to live the life
I ought to live. This begs the question, what kind of life ought a
person (myself) live? I still don&rsquo;t know the answer to this question,
but it seems to me that I ought to live the life I want. I don&rsquo;t
intend this to sound selfish, but the life I want is different than
that of what my family, society, culture, etc. is constantly telling
me I should live. I can try to fit the lifestyle I want into the mold
of what I&rsquo;m told is acceptable, but I am starting to think beyond
that.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;ve been inspired to let go of the material things that clutter my
physical space and mind as well as that do not add value to my life or
the lives of those around me. I don&rsquo;t exactly know what this sort of
revelation means for my future, but I imagine it meaning something
along the lines of not having my own &ldquo;home&rdquo; but rather the world is my
home. I want to travel and experience. I think so often people say
they want to travel, but it becomes sort of a &ldquo;where will my next
vacation be?&rdquo; kind of idea. As for me, I&rsquo;d prefer a &ldquo;where is my next
temporary home?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This world is so big and I am coming to find that the longer I live,
the more I want to experience foreign places, concepts, and
cultures. I think this kind of thing is good to start thinking
about. When I would think of my future in the sense of graduating,
finding a job, creating income and moving into my own space, an so on,
I am filled with anxiety. When I think of my future as letting go and
seeing where possibilities may take me, I feel some sense of comfort.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m not sure if this is complete ludicrous or a goal that I very well
could achieve. I would like to know your thoughts on this! I know this
was long and you are busy with school, so no hurry. Whenever you get a
chance I would like to hear what you have to say on the subject.
</p>

<p>
Thanks &lt;3
</p>

<p>
Lisa

<p>
I feel like college doesn&rsquo;t teach students <i>how to disagree</i>. By <i>how to
disagree</i> I mean how to deal with disgreement, or how to resolve
disagreements in a civil manner. In a writing argument, I felt as
though everyone in the class was learning how to be persuasive about
whatever it is they think is true, that is, how to make it sound like
you&rsquo;re right. Managing <i>real</i> disagreement strikes me as precisely the
activity that teaches people how to recognize when they are <i>wrong</i>. If
we are not practicing to recognize when we are wrong, but are instead
only taught how to appear persuasive (often arguing against people who
aren&rsquo;t in the classroom), it would follow that one never learns the
appropriate way to react when in a disagreement, possibly sensitive?
</p>

<p>
I have had this thought before, but it has just now come back to me: I
think it best in any situation not to state a disagreement if you are
not prepared to explain yourself.
</p>

<p>
Have been spending valuable time on the internet reading articles and
things on civil discourse, intellectual humility and scientific
humility. I want to be able to describe the feelings that I have for
the idea of &rsquo;humility,&rsquo; but I am not so sure this is exactly the right
way to describe the attitutes to which I am inclined. This began in my
research of the Intellectual Dark Web and controversial speakers,
first focusing on free speech and then narrowed into civil discourse.

don&rsquo;t want to just live a mundane day-to-day life.
</p>

<p>
Even if I lived in one place and did one thing, I would want to be
adding value and change to my life.
</p>

<p>
I think one of the big things is that - the biggest and most important
thing that I am trying to learn is how to take risks.
</p>

<p>
It&rsquo;s easy to just stay and do what you&rsquo;ve been doing. I applied to all

<p>
Using that as motivation to continue to learn about it even if it&rsquo;s
confusing or hard. Because I didn&rsquo;t get it the way some people got
it. I can see why there is such a appreciation for it, where I could
barely remember 1776, but if I can find a reason to have more meaning
then it makes it easier. I think it&rsquo;s almost as if a burnout of being
in grade school. When you have the opportunity to choose your school
and classes it&rsquo;s better. Sets grade school apart from higher
education. I feel like I have a fundamental - I don&rsquo;t know - because
when you learn things, you can learn sine cosine and tangents but if
you understand why it works it is more meaningful. I remember
chemistry being so hard and doing surprisingly well but I remember
trying to do homework and not getting it. I would go to tutoring and
try to figure out, make sure that I knew what was going on. I would
not focus as much on the grade, as much as learning what I am supposed
to learn.
</p>

<p>
I have been trying so hard to become self disciplined, and love myself
enough to not let food become something that is more than it should
be. Things, food, money can&rsquo;t buy happiness. Focus more on the value
you&rsquo;re bringing. I&rsquo;m trying to become more disciplined because - it&rsquo;s
so scary to think about - being a sophomore not being able to wait to
be on the team for three years, looking back and thinking time flies
so fast and that those were the good old days. I don&rsquo;t want to be on
my death bed and think that I didn&rsquo;t do the things that I wanted to
do. I&rsquo;m the biggest thing holding myself back. What I do directly
impacts what experience I have and the experiences I have impact who I
am. Hopefully this makes sense.
</p>

<p>
Yes, that is a motivating thought. The mindset defines the life I&rsquo;m
living. When we try to talk and I am not in the mood. Sometimes I am
and sometimes I am not in the right headspace. Balance between living
how I have been living while having the drive from the mindset that
motivates me.
</p>

<p>
As I was finishing the book, about awe and humbling things, I need to
constantly be in a place where I can feel that.
</p>

<p>
If I&rsquo;m not on the edge of my comfort zone I&rsquo;m never gonna grow.
</p>

<p>
Okay now it seems that I need to get used to this new way of deleting
words with the control key. I also need to get back to focusing on my
rhetorical analysis, which I have done in regards to Jason Helms and
the postmodern viewpoints. It as been quite hard to parse through some
of the convoluted descriptions of things. I find a tremendous amount
of difficulty with verbose explanations. The idea of &ldquo;clarity is a
myth,&rdquo; while true in the sense that nothing makes perfect sense, seems
to be a sort of way to justify using convoluted explanations of
reality. When presented with a new thing to learn in class, seldom are
we offered explanations as to why these things are effective. Or, ore
precisely, why we ought to be learning them.
</p>

<p>
I continue writing my thoughts on things that are happening now. I am
about to make some food, thought I sense that my mind is not quite in
the best place to continue my rhetorical analysis. I am looking at my
optics book, not while I type, though. It is 11:47 PM and I woke up
just about 6 hours ago. Will need to be in class tomorrow from 9:40 to
1, also meeting with Dr. Hana afterward.
</p>

<p>
I have just thought that teaching in the writing class should be about
what someone is trying to say, and how this lines up with what people
perceive it as. One big thing that I would like to talk about is that
it seemed the major project was to be done in reinforcing some
previously help opinion. This is to say that I was assigned to pick
something that I felt I was right about in the public sphere and then
find justification and write about it. Language changes over
time. There is no right or wrong way to use language, which I agree
with. I do not agree, however, that there should not be a common goal
in using language, to understand people and to be understood. I do not
get the impression that many people genuinely try to be
misunderstood. I also anticipate that people do not go out trying to
say things that are easy to refute. People express opinions because
they genuinely think that they are right about it, and that there
isn&rsquo;t a real argument that disproves them that is known of to them. It
should not be left to the reader to interpret the text. It should be
the goal of the reader to understand what the writer is saying in a
frame that makes the most sense. Text is not simply there for anyone
to interpret however they like. There must be a firm recognition of
human fallibility involved. A skepticism about their own skepticism,
resorting to the assertion that one simply does not know the answer.

feel like I really have any desire to convince someone else to do a
certain thing. I keep tending to want to show people how they may be
wrong. Presenting a disagreement course for TCU?

Thinking out loud here. But on the computer, so not out loud. Should I configure my Emacs settings like I have planned right now? Or should I start immediately on more pertinent tasks. Well, so I messed with some things on the emacs settings. Hopefully the &ldquo;sp-up-sexp&rdquo; things will be quicker to use now, though I may need to take some extra time to get used to it. Also just messed with the &ldquo;fill-column/fill-paragraph&rdquo; settings. Now I better have some super efficient writing! Perhaps a waste of time trying to mess with these little settings here and there, though I seem to enjoy it very much. I just discovered &ldquo;auto-fill-mode&rdquo; also, and this is the greatest thing! I will add this to be in every major mode, or perhaps just org mode for now.
</p>

<p>
Now is about the time that I should think about working on my school stuff. I do only have three class days of college left, after all (assuming that everything goes OK in these next couple of
days).

Writing seems such a strange thing to me. The more that I think about writing, theless that I want to do it. By this, I mean that the act of writing itself seems to require also a thought process which seeks to edit the text that is thought to type. My professor has mentioned that to try and do both simultaneously, to write and to edit, is a futile job. Perhaps this hassomething to do with the idea of &ldquo;writer&rsquo;s block&rdquo;? I have all these ideas in my head, perhaps I am subconsciously avoiding the idea of reading my own words on the screen, with the fear that theywon&rsquo;t represent my view entirely (they won&rsquo;t). I should have more time to think on the nature ofwriting once my schooling has finished. Now I must continue working on my assignments which are due this week. Tomorrow, I can turn in a &ldquo;doing geography&rdquo; exercise for extra credit in my cultural geography class. I currently have a 71 or so in the class. This may be necessary if I intend on getting at least a C. Since it is nearly 4 in the afternoon, and I have class again tomorrow at 9 inthe morning, before which I would have to complete this assignment, I should make sure I have my priorities straight. Doing geography should not take more than two hours, I presume. Though my8-page report for 20803 due on Thursday will likely take long and will need to be started today. Since I am not worried so much about the former, I shall start brainstorming the structure of
this report.
</p>

<p>
The report should be similar to a proposal. My professor and I have decided that the audience will be the committee that is in charge of determining the content of the 20803 course or written communication required credit. I really feel the need to acknowledge the fact that I am only a college student and that I have no lengthy experience studying the nature of rhetoric and argumentative writing. Any committee who receives such a report from a student is sure to expect little, and I would not blame them for this. Also, it should be noted that I am evidently the only student who seems to have had any sort of trouble with the course. Given that my hypothesis is about how student seriousness is directly related to perceived difficulty, I guess the lack of consensus on difficulty could be explained by a lack of seriousness among other classmates. For one thing, I doubt that the others have cared to look more into the philosophy of rhetoric or to understand really why they might need to understand the purpose of persuasive arguments. It seems much more pertinent to the course to just write, and not to focus too hard on <i>why</i> you are writing in the first place. Then again, perhaps the reason is that one wants to graduate and be done with college. This is not the case for me, though, as I have come to value my role as a student &ldquo;sponge,&rdquo; taking each course with a seriousness about learning that seeks to absorb as much as possible, and that I also plan to go to graduate school in physics.
</p>

<p>
Okay, so is one point going to be that the more seriously one takes the course, the harder that it becomes to see the point? I don&rsquo;t particularly like this at the moment. I do think that my difficulties with the course stemmed quite directly from some ideas which surround the philosophy behind mindfulness, or mindfulness meditation. Recognizing that the words to follow are quite fluffy, it seems to be a kind of self-awareness that has prevented me from accepting the prospect of argumentative writing wholeheartedly (or at least from understanding it). When I think to write, I generally think quite seriously about the idea that another human may end up on the receiving end of my work. <i>Arguing</i> some point, that is to say that I am correct about something, perhaps betrays the notion that I am at all times fallible. Such a notion seems to have come out of my experience with mindfulness meditation, if not at least causing better recognition of it. Sometimes I wonder if I have been averse to my capability of holding conceit starting when I was a child. I did manage some sort of mental transformation in my coming of age, just before high school. Starting then to ask more questions about the world and to eventually find tremendous fascination with music, technology, science, and life in general. Perhaps it was a sort of &ldquo;rediscovery of wonder&rdquo; - such is the phrase that comes to mind.
</p>

<p>
Now, I couldn&rsquo;t have expected myself to say these things about myself without acknowledging that I have in no way convinced myself of having reached some moral high-ground or enlightenment. Nonetheless, relating this back to the assignment that I have agreed to complete, I figure I must have some general understand for the type of student that I am. Intentional? Motivated? My professor seems to have indicated already that I am a student who really cares about the topic, though I think it more accurate to say that I simply care more about learning and the university environment in general. Though I am working on letting this show in all of my wakeful hours, I do seem to have found an intense admiration, appreciation, and motivation toward being alive. As I shake my head in disbelief toward my own certainty in this idea, learning is quintessential to life. The logic is perhaps straightforward in that my audience will with no doubt agree in the primacy of learning. Specifically, I intend to address the notions of learning procedurally and learning for understanding. Not only asking what I might need to learn, but also <i>how</i> I could be learning. My professor has also said this in class, hoping to teach us &ldquo;how to learn.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Reviewing what I have thought of so far, I have that I should be able to describe the kind of student that I am. This student I might describe as being a nerd, a learner, enthusiastic about school, or something of the sort. I know that I seek to believe as many true things and as few false things as possible, while also trying to connect with other people in new, deep and insightful ways. This inevitably includes my professors, though I don&rsquo;t think this point is quite relevant. What I am perhaps trying to say is that I genuinely look at each class that I take as an important way of understanding the world. Cultural geography, for one, has shown itself to be a cause for change in the way I think about my drives around Fort Worth, wonder in every gaze upon a particular style of architecture or of a weather-beaten building from a past time and culture, (not to mention the effects of globalization). Anyways, I take each class to be an opportunity to learn something that I did not know before. What an obvious statement to make about a university. And yet it strikes me, too, that it is not entirely common for students to have fully embraced this idea. That they might be learning something that they once did not know. There can be no honest attempt to understand what is going to be taught in a course before taking it, because you do not know the content of the course. Such is the reason that you are at the university in the first place! <i>You don&rsquo;t know what you don&rsquo;t know</i>, is what I think of. Or, to be more precise, I mean that as students it is easy to prepare a little section of your brain for the knowledge you are going to receive, based on your impressions of what it will be. Would it be ideal then to guide the information into this structure you have created, or to say simply &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; and be fully open to surprise.
</p>

<p>
My thoughts on the idea of claiming to know what you don&rsquo;t know aren&rsquo;t perhaps developed with regard to the classroom, though as I type this sentence I am seeing connections even to my thoughts on religion and other things. Intellectual humility seems to keep coming up in these topics, it sure appears to be close to the &ldquo;central node.&rdquo; Again, to recap, I think it would be relevant to describe myself as an open-minded student, perhaps one who feels he has understood the importance of doubting all things and being aware of his own gaps in understanding. &ldquo;Self-correcting&rdquo; maybe a better, more concise term. Most importantly to this project I tend to require that I understand things to a sufficient level prior to acting or believing in them, where measuring this level of understanding has been only possible in deep conversation with others. Striving to understand an idea or situation and not simply trying to agree with others. Being able to explain my own thought processes has become important, especially with the requirement that they are indeed <i>my own</i>. If they were not my own, then I would not be measuring my level of understanding but someone else&rsquo;s instead. This would not be <i>learning</i>. Of course I will not be able to say all of this about myself in the op-ed, only a brief contextual description. Most of the ideas here are developed, I&rsquo;d say, so I think it would be good to move on to the points to be made about the course.
</p>

<p>
My first idea is to introduce the situation chronologically. I entered the class with vague notions of &ldquo;postmodernism&rdquo; and confusion from my other previous two English courses. I was skeptical about Helms&rsquo; teaching style, though saw a lot of meaning in the idea of argument as a non-negative activity. I wound up in a group which was to argue collectively about the injustices of TCU&rsquo;s meal plan system. I remember thinking that I had terribly low interest in doing this, in addition to having spent time analyzing countless arguments about religion, skepticism, philosophy and politics (thanks to Street Epistemology and the &ldquo;Intellectual dark web&rdquo;). I found it to be a great opportunity, and possibly thinking that it might turn out to be easier, to focus on arguing about something that was important.
</p>

<p>
As the course went on, however, I found myself struggling more and more in expressing my opinions through writing. My stance would continually change while researching and reading up on the differing perspectives on the topic of free speech in America. It eventually came to questioning what it even means to hold an opinion, or really what it means to persuade someone to agree with your opinion. All I knew at the time was that I wasn&rsquo;t too keen on the apparent intentions of Dr. Helms, and that I did not feel justified in creating a piece of writing with the intention of changing someone&rsquo;s mind.
</p>

<p>
What does it mean to change someone&rsquo;s mind, then? To persuade, to convince, to do what arguments are designed to do (at least in the way that the textbook presents it)? How sure of my own view do I have to be before I decide that it would be alright to try and persuade others to agree? This is the core of the issue that I was able to identify. I had a deep-seeded issue with the prospect of setting out to change someone&rsquo;s mind. It seemed that in order to rationally have this goal, I would need to have steadfast confidence in my own opinion and/or ignorance of my own fallibility. So long as I might be mistaken, who is to say that my ideas are any better than someone else&rsquo;s? Maybe you shouldn&rsquo;t listen to my opinion because I am just a college student, what do I really know?
</p>

<p>
And thus I had thrust myself into the realm of epistemology. Already having accepted my fate in the wise words of Feynman, who I still adore, &ldquo;Some people say, how can you live without knowing? I do not know what they mean. I always live without knowing. That is easy. How you get to know is what I want to know.&rdquo; Of course, with care to avoid the paradox of having certainty in the idea of uncertainty; skeptical of my own skepticism, one might say. Having already reserved my ability to doubt all things, I naturally began to doubt myself and my own opinions with regards to my argumentative writing. It might not be the most persuasive way to argue something, doubting the very thing that you are tasked to persuade people of.
</p>

<p>
Here, I think, could be my first contention with the nature of the course: that there seems little room allowed for doubt. An argument against this, and evidently the first that I heard, could be just not to take it <i>that</i> seriously. Those less interested seem readily able to submit writing which makes no real effort to correspond with their own reasoning. This seems even to be encouraged by the textbook that we had been assigned, especially in its presentation of the Toulmin strategy. To be more clear, I guess that the course favors those who do not doubt their own reasoning. It may be that someone is less interested and thus spends less time worrying about the accuracy of their writing, and/or that the student has not experienced the benefits of doubt and still associates it with negativity or fear. In either case, this student appears to be in a better situation than one who insists on doubting himself.
</p>

<p>
I do not plan to argue the benefits of doubt, nor the righteousness of scientific skepticism, though I wonder if simply discriminating against those who doubt is grounds enough for change. Perhaps instead of discrimination it is more of a pressure toward certainty? Not even that, I think, this appears to lie in what Dr. Helms said about the textbook which may well be true about the course itself: that there is an assumed goal to change people&rsquo;s minds (or, to persuade). What would happen, then, to a student who has spiritually (for lack of a better word) come to the decision that he should in fact question everything, including himself? It would not come easy to him, then, to have confidence in his own rightness about a controversial issue. If he is a human, and those who read his writing are human, and he would like to do onto others as he would want them to do unto him, then he may be faced with a deep moral dilemma. To attempt or not to attempt to persuade?
</p>

<p>
Now is about where it would be very useful to define, or to have already defined, the differences between convincing, persuading and explaining. The first two are assumed to have the goal of changing someone&rsquo;s mind, where convincing moves a reader to an opinion, and persuasion moves an opinionated reader to action. Explaining is the most broad of these, it seems. In the way that I am inclined to use the term &ldquo;explain,&rdquo; it carries a goal not of <i>winning</i> or changing minds, but of being properly understood. I explained this thinking to Dr. Helms earlier today and it seemed to be cogent that when it comes to <i>understanding</i> and <i>agreement</i>, there are four possible rhetorical situations, each a permutation of the binaries of being understood and being in agreement. Now the question is, which of these is the most desirable? Or, to take from our previous conversation, a better question might be to ask if one outcome should precede the other?
</p>

<p>
More to the point, I think that one should not be concerned with agreement if a mutual understanding is not met first. Like the Rogerian argument, understanding now becomes more a more central goal, instead of agreement or changing one&rsquo;s mind. One potentially good point to make would be to distinguish between the two cases in which agreement occurs. When we say that we would like to persuade the reader to agree, must it also be said that we are trying to also convey an understanding? Which comes first? Try and just get the reader to agree? Or, try and get the reader to understand first, and then <i>if your argument makes sense</i> to the reader, they might agree? It seems dangerous to ignore the situation that is known all to well, where someone is persuaded to agree but is not able to accurately explain the very argument which has caused their persuasion. The contrast of judging and argument by its conclusion, or its reverse, a conclusion by its argument, seems awfully relevant as well. This important case to consider might well be described in saying that sometimes the reader will judge an argument by its conclusion, and not the other way around as it should be.
</p>

<p>
Relating this idea back to the concept of doubt, I think that the doubting individuals are naturally inclined to seek only those conclusions which have good arguments. In this situation, as is the situation that I seem to have found myself in, the expectations of the student and that of 20803 may no longer be compatible. Being a reader, the skeptic has no problem evaluating arguments. Being the writer, however, in doubt of his own thoughts the skeptic is compelled by simple moral principles to avoid misleading the reader and thus to avoid convincing another of his position. After all, he has
not even convinced himself that his opinion is true - only that at present it is his best guess.

I have been talking with Lisa the past couple of nights while my English project ideas have been swirling around in my head, and something struck me about it today. Sometimes it seems that in one-on-one conversations it can be more logical to express my opinion rather than to

I wrote some today. It&rsquo;s not as readable as I thought, so I wonder if I should just write the same gibberish that I wrote in the first journal. That way I can save all important and actually thought-out thoughts for typing here. Much easier to navigate through earlier thoughts and times and stuff. I think that will be cool to look back on as well. For now, I say I will try that. Write enough to get me to want to type out some actually coherent thoughts and then continue on to my todo list and the tasks that I have to complete for the day. Rearranged the game room once again and I like it a lot. Standing up and typing right now - should be back here to type some more tomorrow morning. Looking forward to taking some more time alone. Off to bed I go.

Okay today I don&rsquo;t know what I am doing. I know very well all of the things that I have told myself that I need to do. I am in need of a way to start to take care of these tasks in a time-efficient manner. My own mental health has been a concern to me lately, if I am being honest. Currently I feel at ease, though, playing ambient music as I stand and type upstairs at home. Just had the thought that <i>it is always now</i>. The present moment consists of nice music for me, gentle lighting of a computer screen, typing with my fingers and their reflection in the screen moving and the red shirt &ldquo;I eat TaCOS periodically&rdquo; in the background of the reflection. The song is <i>Sedentary II</i> by Kyle Bobby Dunn, which reminds me of my tendency for sedentary lifestyle and the potential health risks associated with reduced exercise. I did go for a 3-mile run today with Lisa so I suppose that counts, though I think I spent a great deal of time doing that. This is a thing that I have still to think about - the thing being my time-management with regards to social activities since being home. Social things are what primarily distracts me from doing the research and more goal-oriented things that I want to do each day. It seems I am always looking for something to do with Lisa, Avery, my Parents, and also occasionally Austin (seeing as we stayed up until 2 AM playing the game &ldquo;No Man&rsquo;s Sky&rdquo; last night).
</p>

<p>
Hopefully I can figure out a solution to my seemingly conflicting interests of maintaining  meaningful relationships and also working toward my personal goals. I don&rsquo;t &ldquo;personal goals&rdquo; is an adequate way to describe those things which I have set for myself but I cannot think of anything better at the moment.
</p>

<p>
Back to the question that I always try to answer when typing like this - what am I going to do next? Considering my own mortality, of course. Is there any way that I can prepare myself to work without becoming too distracted? Perhaps what I am doing now is a distraction since I am not actually working on anything that I set out to work on here. I must work on deciding what to work on, at least, as I have asked the question already.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Miller has always responded to my emails and in conversation with lots of support for me. I don&rsquo;t quite know what to think often when I do not come through with the things that I had expected myself to complete, and he still seems relatively optimistic. Dr. Hana, on the other hand, has not responded to my email which asked if she would be available to chat either yesterday or today. Also in that email was a promise to send another email regarding some parameters in the code that I&rsquo;ve developed for the project, which I did not send. Perhaps she is waiting on that, and if so, I may be looking especially unreliable right about now.
</p>

<p>
An amplifier cord adapter sits on the shelf to my left - guitars just below it and the amplifiers themselves on the floor to my right. I had the thought earlier today that my recent affinity for practicing the piano and guitar have perhaps been methods for me to escape those things which I have to do. They are things that have always seemed a good thing to practice, though at this time I am not so sure that I need to be doing them. I am beginning to think that music is more of a distraction now than a useful hobby. I sure hope that this isn&rsquo;t correct, what I am saying, for I really do love playing musical instruments and have always been quite good at picking them up. I think I have just decided, though, in writing this, that it may be best for me to try and stay away from the guitars and pianos for a while. Maybe I need to put them in another room, or at least away from where I am trying to work on my things. Now that I have made this decision, I think that I will see how it goes trying to avoid them and then see if I do need to move them away after all.
</p>

<p>
I&rsquo;m afraid I may have a poor attitude regarding my tasks. Sitting down to get started on them, I frequently find myself thinking sort-of hopelessly about actually doing whatever I plan to do. Actually it&rsquo;s mainly a feeling that I have signed myself for too many projects at the same time that perhaps I have been to busy trying to figure out what task to do rather than actually doing one. <i>Thrashing</i>, is the concept that comes to mind. My head, like the virtual memory in a machine, is too busy swapping tasks in and out, only briefly processing each one before moving on to the next, that neither is seeing really any progress. Of course, I am capable of escaping this thrashing by simply unloading both tasks and doing other less-meaningful social tasks. It seems I should just pick one and go with it, though it would be much nicer to know which one to do. Of course, the two mental processes that I am thinking of are my projects with Dr. Miller and Dr. Hana. Also, I need to think of my things with Bala. I have not developed an understanding of him yet to adequately prioritize what he has asked me to do. This being said, I don&rsquo;t think those things that he has asked of me are nearly as immediately important as the other two.
</p>

<p>
Alright so now we are deciding between Dr. Hana and Dr. Miller (I have just thought if any other people or tasks that I have should be prioritized above these and I do not think that I have found any) Dr. Hana is  waiting on me for the code reply, so this already seems it should be of great importance to complete very soon. Dr. Miller, though he is evidently very understanding and supportive, has also been waiting a long time for any info from me. The deadline for working on his stuff is basically Friday. As for Hana, I may also be able to meet with her on Friday, now that I think of it. Given that it is currently midday on Wednesday, I could conceivably start working on revisiting my code for Dr. Hana and then coming up with a satisfactory answer to her question about the parameters. Once this is done, I could begin the long task of converting my outline of the paper for Dr. Miller&rsquo;s research into an actual paper. One section, I should do, perhaps.
</p>

<p>
It is good to sometimes do things which you had no plans of doing. I have though this thought for a while now, especially during those times when I feel that I must plan out my entire days just to get done all of the things that I have assigned myself to do. It seems to make an incredible amount of sense to me that on cannot plan out one&rsquo;s whole life, of course. Lot&rsquo;s of learning takes place which we take on activities for no apparent reason other than for our own curiosity. I can develop this thought more in typing later, though I think it should not be forgotten in my actions to come soon.
</p>

<p>
A couple of times in writing this I have been distracted by either my dogs or by one person coming to the front door. I wonder if perhaps I need to find a better area to work or think. My room is very good, though I cannot stand and type in there.
</p>

<p>
Thinking about the possibility that I might actually have come to a conclusion about how I should proceed with regard to my tasks, the idea of &ldquo;just doing it&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t sit will. Such is a phrase that seems vulnerable to action without seeking understanding first, though at this point I have found a strong reason to &ldquo;just do it&rdquo; in the fact that I will someday die. Often I cannot afford to sit around and think about what I need to do or what the best way to do it is - in the interest of my own time here on the freaking planet I must do what I actually want to do, based on whatever it seems is my best guess on how to do it right at this moment. So, without looking to justify my conclusions further in writing I am coming to a conclusion about my tasks now. I should work on my code for Dr. Hana first, then write a paragraph or two for Dr. Miller, then try the mellin transform in Dr. Hana, and repeat back to writing for Miller if there is more time to spend in making an update file for Dr. Hana. Explaining to them my current situation should also involve the idea of thrashing. Hopefully I have learned something!
