* The Model
 
Infection in the respiratory tract is modeled by the following partial
differential equations of the concentrations of target cells ($T$),
infected/eclipsed cells ($E$), infectious cells ($I$), and
the virus ($V$):

$$\partial_{t}T=-\beta TV,$$
$$\partial_{t}E=\beta TV-\frac{E}{\tau_\subE},$$
$$\partial_{t}I=\frac{E}{\tau_\subE}-\frac{I}{\tau_\subI},$$
$$\partial_{t}V=pI-cV+D\partial_x^{2}V+\nu\partial_{x}V,$$

where $\tau_\subE$ and $\tau_\subI$ represent the cell stage tranfer
timescales from eclipsed and infectious cells, and $p$, $c$, $D$, and
$\nu$ represent the rates of virion production, clearance, diffusion,
and advection, respectively. Lastly, the strength of interaction
between the virus and target cells is given by the parameter
$\beta$. All parameter values are restricted to the positive real
numbers unless stated otherwise. Notice that $\nu>0$ signifies advection 
of the virus in the negative $x$ direction.


** Traveling Wave Solution

The solution to the proposed system will be considered in the form of
a wave which travels down the respiratory tract at a constant velocity
$\alpha$, against the flow of advection. We seek equations for the
system under a change of coordinates $(x,t)$ to $(z,\tau)$, where
$\tau=t$ and $z=x+\alpha{}t$, as is done similarly by Farlow
cite:farlow1993. Using the chain rule for each of the four functions,
we now have the following system:

$$\partial_{t}T=-\beta TV-\alpha\partial_{z}T,$$
$$\partial_{t}E=\beta TV-\frac{E}{\tau_\subE}-\alpha\partial_{z}E,$$
$$\partial_{t}I=\frac{E}{\tau_\subE}-\frac{I}{\tau_\subI}-\alpha\partial_{z}I,$$
$$\partial_{t}V=pI-cV+D\partial_z^{2}V+(\nu-\alpha)\partial_{z}V.$$

Notice that $\tau$ is only used for clarity in employing the chain
rule, for example in the case of the target cells:
$$\partial_{t}T=\frac{\partial T}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial
T}{\partial z}\frac{\partial z}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial
T}{\partial\tau}\frac{\partial\tau}{\partial t}=\alpha\partial_z T+\partial_\tau T.$$
Since $\tau=t$, we will refer to this time variable as $t$ from now
on. Perhaps, since further analysis involves a complex variable, it
may also be less confusing to return to the variable $x$ in place of
$z$, though we still continue with $z$.

*** Laplace Transformation

Equipped with the appropriate frame of reference, we now seek to
remove partial differentials in $z$ through the laplace transform,
$$\mathscr{L}[A(z,t)]=\int_0^x Ae^{-qz}dz=\mathscr{A}(q,t).$$ 
Applying this 
notation to the same four translated equations mentioned before, we have:

$$\partial_{t}\mathscr{T} = -\beta \left(\mathscr{T} \ast \mathscr{V}\right) -\alpha q\mathscr{T}+\alpha T_0,$$
$$\partial_{t}\mathscr{E} = \beta \left(\mathscr{T} \ast \mathscr{V}\right) -\mathscr{E}\left(\frac{1}{\tau_\subE}+\alpha q\right)+\alpha E_0,$$
$$\partial_{t}\mathscr{I} =\frac{\mathscr{E}}{\tau_\subE}-\mathscr{I}\left(\frac{1}{\tau_\subI}+\alpha q\right)+\alpha I_0,$$
$$\partial_{t}\mathscr{V} = p\mathscr{I} + \left(Dq^2 + (\nu-\alpha)q-c\right)\mathscr{V} + \left(Dq+\nu-\alpha\right)V_0+DV_0'.$$

The zero subscripts signify the value of that function at the lower
bound of the transform, $z=0$, while still functions of
time. Simplifying the system, we consider the scenario in which the
single wave is sufficiently far away, such that all concentrations at
$z=0$ are negligible. Over the complex variable $q$, we now have nicer
equations for time derivatives of the laplace transforms of the
concentrations, yielding the following Jacobian:

$$\mathscr{J} = 
\begin{pmatrix}
-\beta\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathscr{T}}\left(\mathscr{T} \ast \mathscr{V} \right)-\alpha q & 0 & 0 & -\beta\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathscr{V}}\left(\mathscr{T} \ast \mathscr{V} \right) \\
\beta\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathscr{T}}\left(\mathscr{T} \ast \mathscr{V} \right) & -\left(\alpha q + \frac{1}{\tau_\subE}\right) & 0 & \beta\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathscr{V}}\left(\mathscr{T} \ast \mathscr{V} \right) \\
0 & \frac{1}{\tau_\subE} & -\left(\alpha q + \frac{1}{\tau_\subI}\right) & 0 \\
0 & 0 & p & Dq^2+\left(\nu-\alpha\right)q-c \\
\end{pmatrix}$$

Readily, it may be seen that the roots of the associated
characteristic equation are: $$\lambda_1 =
-\beta\frac{\partial}{\partial\mathscr{T}}\left(\mathscr{T} \ast
\mathscr{V} \right),$$ $$\lambda_2=-\alpha q - \frac{1}{\tau_\subE},$$
$$\lambda_3=-\alpha q - \frac{1}{\tau_\subI},$$
$$\lambda_4=Dq^2+\left(\nu-\alpha\right)q-c.$$

From these, we may gather restrictions on the value of
$\operatorname{Re}\left[q\right]$ for which the system has a stable
solution; the stability condition being that all $\lambda<0$. Notice
that the stability criterion from $\lambda_1$ will not be as easily
expressible. It is still to be determined whether or not this will
affect the range of $\operatorname{Re}[q]$ which is specified by the
other roots.

$$\operatorname{Re}[q]>-\frac{1}{\alpha\tau_\subE}$$
$$\operatorname{Re}[q]>-\frac{1}{\alpha\tau_\subI}$$
$$-\frac{\nu-\alpha}{2D}-\sqrt{\left(\frac{\nu-\alpha}{2D}\right)^2+\frac{c}{D}}<\operatorname{Re}[q]<-\frac{\nu-\alpha}{2D}+\sqrt{\left(\frac{\nu-\alpha}{2D}\right)^2+\frac{c}{D}}$$

It will be useful to define each of the four boundary values of $q$:

$$ q_\subE=-\frac{1}{\alpha\tau_\subE},$$
$$ q_\subI=-\frac{1}{\alpha\tau_\subI},$$

#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\begin{equation}\label{qpm}
q_{\pm}=-\frac{\nu-\alpha}{2D}\pm\sqrt{\left(\frac{\nu-\alpha}{2D}\right)^2+\frac{c}{D}},
\end{equation}
#+END_EXPORT

where the stability condition for $\operatorname{Re}[q]$ can be
written more concisely as:

#+BEGIN_EXPORT latex
\begin{equation}\label{req}
\sup\left(q_\subE, q_\subI, q_{-}\right)<\operatorname{Re}[q]<q_{+}}.
\end{equation}
#+END_EXPORT

This is a result of our initial parameters only being able to take positive
values, meaning $q_\subE$, $q_\subI$, and $q_{-}$ must all be $<0$, and
that $q_{+}>0$, while $\operatorname{Re}[q]$ lies somewhere in between.

*** Steady State Solutions

The transformed system presented in the previous section may be used
to find properties of a steady state solution. Setting the time derivatives 
equal to zero yields the following:

$$\mathscr{T}=\frac{\beta}{\alpha}\frac{1}{q}\left(\mathscr{T}\ast\mathscr{V}\right),$$
$$\mathscr{E}=\beta\left(\frac{1}{\alpha
q+\frac{1}{\tau_\subE}}\right)\left(\mathscr{T}\ast\mathscr{V}\right),$$
$$\mathscr{I}=\frac{1}{\tau_\subE}\left(\frac{1}{\alpha
q+\frac{1}{\tau_\subI}}\right)\mathscr{E},$$
$$\mathscr{V}=-p\left(\frac{1}{Dq^2+\left(\nu-\alpha)q-c\right)}\right)\mathscr{I},$$

And since there are no derivatives left to worry about, we may combine
these into a single expression for $\mathscr{V}$ in terms of $\mathscr{T}$,

$$\mathscr{V}=-\frac{p\alpha}{\tau_\subE}\left(\frac{1}{Dq^2+
\left(\nu-\alpha)q-c\right)}\right)\left(\frac{1}{\alpha
q+\frac{1}{\tau_\subI}}\right)\left(\frac{1}{\alpha
q+\frac{1}{\tau_\subE}}\right)(q\mathscr{T}).$$

Before attempting the inverse transform of this, it is worth noting
that there are apparently several poles in the space of the complex
variable $q$. Rewriting the previous equation in a more familiar form
shows this clearly:

$$\mathscr{V}=-\frac{p}{k\tau_\subE\alpha^2D}\left(\frac{k}{\left(q +
\frac{\nu-\alpha}{2D}\right)^2-k^2)}\right)\left(\frac{1}{
q+\frac{1}{\alpha\tau_\subI}}\right)\left(\frac{1}{
q+\frac{1}{\alpha\tau_\subE}}\right)(q\mathscr{T}),$$

where we have defined the additional parameter $k$ such that

$$k = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\nu-\alpha}{2D}\right)^2+\frac{c}{D}}.$$

The ordinary inverse transform as it has been previously (and possibly erroneously) gathered would be:

$$V=-\frac{p}{k\tau_\subE\alpha^2D}\left(e^{\frac{\nu-\alpha}{2D}z}\sinh kz \ast e^{-\frac{1}{\alpha\tau_\subI}z} \ast e^{-\frac{1}{\alpha\tau_\subE}z} \ast T'\right)$$

Now, taking into account the specification of a region of convergence
(ROC) of $\mathscr{V}$, it is interesting to note that the values of
$q$ at which the function $\mathscr{V}$ /explodes/ are identical to the
boundary values along the real number line that were obtained during
the stability analysis. Note also that given the above definition of
$k$, equation eqref:qpm may be rewritten as:

$$ q_\pm=-\frac{\nu-\alpha}{2D}\pm k.$$

Since poles are present in the laplace transform of the system, 
we need to specify which ROC to use in computing the inverse. Conveniently enough, 
equation eqref:req seems to indicate precisely the region which corresponds to a 
physical steady solution, though it is bounded both on the left and the right 
on the real axis, meaning normal inverse laplace transform techniques may not apply.

The author does not yet have solid grounds by which to carry out the
formula for the inverse laplace transform:

$$\mathscr{L}^{-1}{\mathscr{A}(q,t)}=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\sigma-i\infty}^{\sigma+i\infty}\mathscr{A}e^{qz}dq,$$

though it is understood that $\sigma=\operatorname{Re}[q]$ and lies
within the ROC of $\mathscr{A}$. In the case of our model the ROC is the vertical 
strip in the complex plane given by equation eqref:req.
