\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:orgcd116b2}

\section{The Billiard}
\label{sec:org9716df9}

We consider a spherical billiard with radius \(R\), initially in contact
with the inner surface of an overturned cone of angle \(\theta\), as
seen in [FIGURE]. Note that the position (\(\vec{r}\)) of the center of
this sphere will have a range identical to that of the infinitessimal
billiard, considering that the cone is only vertically separated from
the sphere's center by a distance \(Rsec\theta\). The velocity
(\(\vec{v}\)) of the center of mass of this billiard is just as before,
however we now introduce the angular velocity \(\vec{\omega}\) in
addition to the translational velocity in an effort to simulate a more
realistic system.

In spherical coordinates:

\begin{align*}
\vec{r} &= (r, \theta, \phi) \\
\vec{v} &= (v_r, v_\theta, v_\phi) \\
\vec{\omega} &= (\omega_r, \omega_\theta, \omega_\phi).
\end{align*}

To reduce complication, we take the billiard to be initially in
contact with the cone and in motion, as though the sphere has just
undergone a collision with the immediate surface. Given initial values
of \(\vec{r}\), \(\vec{v}\), and the gravitational strength \(g\), we may
compute the time (\(\tau\)) until the next collision with the cone as
the smallest positive root of the cubic equation [CITE]:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:orgb8cee92}
\frac{1}{4}g^2\tau^3-gv_z\tau^2+\left(v_z^2-gz-v_{xy}^2cot^2\theta\right)\tau+2z\left(v_z+v_{xy}cos\varphi cot\theta\right)=0.
\end{equation}
Cartesian notation is used here only for brevity, where
\(z=rcos\theta\), \(\vec{v}=(v_x,v_y,v_z)\), in conjunction with
the ordinary cylindrical representation of the velocity:
\begin{align*}
v_{xy} &= \sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2} \\
\varphi &= tan^{-1}\frac{v_y}{v_x} \\
v_z &= v_z
\end{align*}
Though the desired root of this cubic equation may be expressed analytically via 
a reduction to the depressed form and substitution of a triple angle formula [CITE],
we have found no clear insight offered there other than for computational simplicity. 
With the correct flight time and gravitational acceleration, application of regular 
three-dimensional kinematics to the initial state \(\vec{\psi}=(\vec{r},\vec{v},\vec{\omega})\) 
yields the new state of the billiard \(\vec{\psi}'\), just prior to impact.

\section{Collisions}
\label{sec:org13610c2}

[Overview]

\subsection{The Impulse Model}
\label{sec:org36658ab}

Since our analysis rests on the assumption that the redirection of the
sphere occurs instantaneously, this ideal billiard must also be
effectively incompressible, making contact with the cone only ever at
a single point. Measured from the center of the sphere, this point
(\(\vec{R}_p\)) is the locus of all impulse (\(\vec\scr{I}\)) to be
delivered to the billiard during a collision, such that \(\vec{R}_p =
R\hat{\theta}\), and \(\hat{\theta}\) represents a unit vector in the direction of 
increasing spherical coordinate \(\theta\).
