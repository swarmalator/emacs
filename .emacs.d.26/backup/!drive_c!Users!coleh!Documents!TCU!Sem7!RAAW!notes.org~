"Use an animal/plant/behavior as description of how to interact with something that you care about"

Abstract analogy to the tree, as the primary structure for gaining conceptual understanding of things. A story of the squirrel, 
in a treetop navigating the beautiful colors of the tree. The idea that mysterious things often have reasons, if one is willing to 
navigate away from the leaves and search for the trunk. 

Relevant qualities of a squirrel.

Squirrel hops around on the tips of branches. An acrobat, dancer, tight-rope walker.
Perhaps instead, the spider monkey.

"Spider Monkey Intelligence"

Can expand on this idea. A tree structure of learning and the student as a spider monkey.

"Write an ode to some thing that triggers the senses, (a guilty pleasure?)"

It really seems to me that guilty pleasures are things that people
should not have.  I am confused as to why we have just spent some time
going around the room asking others what their guilty pleasures are,
in a lighthearted and fun manner, not that it should be darkly
serious, thought they are certainly not things to be complacent of. I
wish to write an ode to something that is intensely and surprisingly
interesting and motivating, particularly where there would not seem to 
be any initial importance. Mathematics comes to mind, or the conceptual 
explanations in physics. I am not sure if this is the intended topic or 
if we are being asked to write more of a pleasurable thing, one that captures 
the emotions in an uncontrolled way; illogically, it would seem. 

I almost want to pick any common piece of technology, for which I
might have just a little bit of historical and technical knowledge,
and write an ode to that which appreciates every human which has
contributed to there being this piece of technology. 

Ode to Electricity
Ode to an Electron
Ode to a Computer
Ode to Richard Feynman
Ode to an Expo Marker

The expo marker,
asleep on metal
awaits a curious hand.

A twist and pull of its cap,
crisp, gentle fumes
tickle the imagination.

Invited is anyone who dares,
Feynman or Fieri

*** Losing Someone
Lisa, Dad, Mom, Grandpa, Miller, Hank
I think we disagreed
I think you were wrong, yet
I think you are human
I think you are trying
When someone is wrong, yet trying not to be.
I am wrong in some way, though I am trying not be as wrong.
To maintain relationships with people you disagree with
you must find an even deeper sense of respect to hold up against 
controversy. The deeper the relationship, the deeper the wound left when ripped apart.
Hank and I had a deeper relationship.
*** Losing Something
Universtity, Youth, Library The University that Robbed me of my
Knowledge It is not what you do not know that get's you into trouble,
It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.  I have learned to say
that I know nothing. Though before, I may very well have thought that
I did. For this reason, the university has robbed me of my
knowledge. Yet all the more, it has shown me what a joke knowledge
is. No one knows. That is the grand punchline of adulthood. Some get
it, others don't. Once one has experienced the freedom in admitting
this, one may continue.  What will one do once one realizes that
he/she is wrong? Will she try to be less wrong? Will he think that he
must be right? 
*** Humorous Loss
I have lost my video game obsession. What a wonderful waste of time
this was.  An addiction, a hunger, a fancy for what seems now to be a
complete hedonic disgrace. It took a certain level of unseriousness to
be this way. To refuse to contemplate the reality of my life. To fall
captive to the growing experience machine on modern technology. How
could I make this funny? Sarcastic? Perhaps not so lighthearted, as I
feel I do not have a particularly light heart. This is not to mean
that I do not find enjoyment in things, only it is to mean that I take
my experiences as thoughtfully as I can, and to ascribe due weights to
all those things which are truly important. Video games fall terribly
short of any kind of such standard.

QOTD: What is something you want to learn how to do? Be a good person.
"God's Work" by Kevin Canty https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/04/04/gods-work
** Freewrite
"Write about a character who undergoes a series of unfortunate events."

Someone who is similar in character to Lisa Waking up in the morning
and from then a series of small things occur that slowly ramp up
anxiety and frustration.  Until there is one thing which sets it just
past the threshold. Small event such as, walking to the front door to
find a large package which has been delivered. Upon bringing the
package into the home, dragging it as it is quite large and tall, the
box becomes unstable and falls to the ground with a loud unsettling
slap. Then the girl who was transporting the box is overcome by sudden
and starling emotion and immediately starts crying and also lies down
on the floor next to the box. Events toward the beginning of the story
could include small everyday things involving other people. Perhaps in
the noble attempt to be an optimist and a people-pleaser, "bottling
up" any negative emotion without proper critical thought to the point
where it overflows. 

In the wake of this are solemn cries for help, maybe to a diety, where
sudden recognition of one's own incapabilities causes great emotional
suffering, even after such an innocuous event. After this event, I
presume it would be common for people to return to a state of false
pride in themselves, to a state which is ready to bottle up more
negative feelings as they come. Only periodically, when this metaphorical 
bottle overflows, are they ever really dealt with. Why, then, shouldn't 
she instead get rid of the bottling regime, and instead try to deal with 
incoming feelings as soon as possible? Deal with, as in taking the time 
to critically think about what one is feeling, what has caused them to 
feel this way, and what problems need to be solved. Of course, if one has 
amassed such a large quantity of uncatered problems, by the time that 
this all boils over, I imagine it could easily overwhelm the person to 
try and asses all of these problemati situations for the first time.

- Dennis Johnson's "Emergency"
** Writing Exercise
"Write about a 20-something y/o confronting parents about their
dissaproval of a decision in the lobby of a retirement home where one
of their grandparents lives."

*** 3rd Person
Should I write about myself? I am in a situation where my grandfather
has been in the hospital recovering from brain surgery. He had a
subdural hematoma, and I have not called or texted him to wish him
good health. I have certainly been thinking of him, as I have thought
to bring this up here, yet I do not feel a terrible urge to let him
know. So I was thinking about this prompt and how it relates to my current 
situation, as if I was to go visit my grandfather in a retirement home and 
confront my parents about this decision that I am making not to speak with 
him. 

Perhaps I write about some fictive characters and the common qualities
of being in the nursing home. The old people smell, the sounds of high
pitched beepers going off in the hallways. The staff dressed in
scrubs, and the open doors exposing the cells of quite vegetable-like
humans.  As for what decision the character could be wrestling with
their parents about, I initially imagine something like finding a
place to live, paying rent for living at home, or some other perhaps
more petty things. I could imagine and describe the specific color of
clothing, just having come from church on a sunday, or the mood of the
family and emotional stress of visiting an elder in such a retirement
home. Perhaps the issue could be with the 20-something year old not 
wanting to be there to visit the older person. Her grandfather, say, 
might not even remember who she his or be able to hold a conversation. 
Though the parents feel that it is important to spend time with family, 
even when the reason for this is not clear.

"Let nature be your teacher: Reflect upon the ways in which the natural word intesects with your life"

This prompt seems to place the definition of the natural world as the
/outside/ world. As in, the desks and chairs in this classroom are
somehow separate from this "natural" world. In the sense that I gather
from physics, *all* of my experience intersects with the natural world.
The natural world is all that it seems that I have. I will concede
that man-made things are what is to be separated from this term,
/artificial/ vs.  /natural/, perhaps. In this sense, it seems that the
artificial has been constructed from the natural, such that the
properties of the natural world reveal themselves in all of the
artificial things. Again, it seems I cannot escape the pervasiveness of 
nature.

Considering my current academic interests, I have become focused
intensely on studying exactly the natural world and its
properties. The ideas and theories about nature that I have
encountered in my studies have completely revamped my experience of
nature, especially in the everyday perceptions of roads, trees,
automobiles, buildings, etc. I instead am inclined to reflect not just
on how the natural world intersects with my life, per se, but how my
life is driven by my fascination with this natural world. What is
called "natural philosophy" is what interests me, and this clearly
would reflect the idea that to me, the natural world is everything.

A flood of questions comes over me sometimes when looking around at
nature - sometimes at very ordinary things. The way light bounces off
the shiny surfaces of cars on the highway as I drove from Austin back
to Fort Worth today, for example. To try and better answer the
question of how nature "intersects" with my life, I guess that nature
intersects with my life as it is the most central source of my
motivations.  It is so interesting/fascinating/humbling/peculiar, and
continually reminds me: "But see that the imagination of nature is
far, far greater than the imagination of man" - R.F.

The test came back, I got an A
My hard work paid off

the next thing I received was a suspension notice

No one believed me 
Even when I cried and cried

You’re trying to teach me how to communicate? 
Then let me speak. 

The many burdens this one thing produced
financial, emotional, academic 

The grief replaced 
my joy 

my hope died 

For a month I sat and waited 
to get an answer 
from people whom I’d never met
who didn’t know me as a person 
but a number 

My future lies in the hands of a stranger?

When the results came 
I knew why 
They didn’t care about me 
but something from me

**** Questions
- What was the suspension for? Using a study helper?
- Something inappropriate was done - cheating? 
- Similar to the poem "Not an Elegy for Mike Brown" in that external knowledge of context is needed.

Listen for the quite pop
Every time I open you, I find you on my fingers,
Forehead and legs
A subtle stench adds to the aroma
Of minds at work with

Mindlessness that gives me space
Multitasking is a rare quality I find only with
You.
I wrap myself around you as I glace between the screen or
Endlessly rant about the same issues to
Few of the same thirteen people

Magic 
Of conversation
Creating more than I can dream of
On a stark, daunting canvas
Between minds that work alike in 
At least one way

"Write about a time you did something you weren't /supposed/ to do, but you did it for good reasons"

I could write about the time I decided not to go to my seminar course
and instead go to a poster presentation session in the physics
department. I confronted the professor about it on that day, once he
realized that I was not in class, and I calmly asked what the
consequences were for not going.

The things that were going through my head on that day were nearly all
about the poster that I had put together for Student Research
Symposium at TCU. I was working on the same project that I am still
focused on today -- trying to mathematically model the progression of
respiratory tract infection for different kinds of patients and
viruses -- and this was the second poster that I was going to present
to the public. My research habits were also less developed then. I
remember I would spend a majority of my time scribbling equations and
working alone without an appropriate amount of time spent trying to
write up my findings in a format that others can read. So, during the
weekend before this presentation session I was gaining practice in
pausing my research and communicating my progress -- practice that I
desperately needed.

The day came, where our posters would be hung in the science building
and the physics department faculty were invited to come judge and
interrogate us about our projects in preparation for the symposium on
the coming Friday.  Unfortunately, my poster session was scheduled at
the same time as one of my physics courses. It was just a one-hour
credit seminar course for freshman physics majors and I was taking it
as a third-year student because it was required. Coincidentally, the
room that this class was held was directly adjacent to the room where
my poster would be hung. Naturally, instead of going to the seminar
course, I went into the poster session to hear what other professors
and students may have been able to say about my poster, on which I had worked 
quite diligently.

flashes guilt. 

Sharp colors of the sun
piercing orange in the fridge light,

Of a ruminant’s stomach. 
No gum, no patch, no regiment works.
