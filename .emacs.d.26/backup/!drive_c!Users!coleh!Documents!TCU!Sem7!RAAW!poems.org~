* Student Driver
\hspace{5cm} =-= after Aimee Nezhukumatathil \\
\vspace{2em}
\par
Praise the honesty of a rear-end collision \\
when the dealer does not flee. I wish upon \\
no one the sharp and unwarranted jolt, \\
producing drivers so bewildered. \\
\par
See the scuff or bent metal or worse, \\
bags enflated. Who has invested more \\
in his ride, gets steamed up most for little \\
effect --- both understand who holds the blame. \\
\par
The receiver cannot prevent what comes \\
from another's uncomfortable acceleration. \\
Both trying to get to where one goes, yet \\
an unintentional misapprehension \\
\par
to signal: /Student/. And Student, I sing \\
your praises not because you attract mistakes \\
like the slow car in front (though I know you \\
are getting faster), but because you hold no blame \\
\par
in your misunderstanding. I may not know \\
what to clarify; I must hear your questions, even \\
when you humbly fear that by asking, your steady \\
brakes will catch my surprise, even if for now, all we can see \\
\par
is a sea of red lights stretching before our path.

* Elegy for Humility
\hspace{5cm} - after Kathryn Simonds \\
\vspace{2em}
\par
We drift apart in thought \\
to leave each other \\
\par
in the unknown world, \\
and, deprived of sense, \\
\par
blind in our opinions; \\
the stinging \\
\par
of the air stirred \\
by your haste; \\
\par
my apartment door \\
loud before and now still. \\
\par
After this talk \\
there'll be another, \\
\par
so we'll listen \\
and keep listening \\
\par
until one of us \\
will speak alone and try to remember \\
\par
what went wrong --- a task \\
the selfish never see --- \\
\par
and it'll be \\
as if we were children, dear, \\
\par
as if together in our folly, \\
our unseen pride, \\
\par
this impasse, between two so naive \\
as to forget humility. \\
\par
Not now. Not anymore.
