\maketitle
\textit{<07/02/18 Mon>}

Writing seems such a strange thing to me. The more that I think about writing, the less that I want
to do it. By this, I mean that the act of writing itself seems to require also a thought process
which seeks to edit the text that is thought to type. My professor has mentioned that to try and do
both simultaneously, to write and to edit, is a futile job. Perhaps this has something to do with
the idea of "writer's block"? I have all these ideas in my head, perhaps I am subconsciously
avoiding the idea of reading my own words on the screen, with the fear that they won't represent my
view entirely (they won't). I should have more time to think on the nature of writing once my
schooling has finished. Now I must continue working on my assignments which are due this
week. Tomorrow, I can turn in a "doing geography" exercise for extra credit in my cultural geography
class. I currently have a 71 or so in the class. This may be necessary if I intend on getting at
least a C. Since it is nearly 4 in the afternoon, and I have class again tomorrow at 9 in the
morning, before which I would have to complete this assignment, I should make sure I have my
priorities straight. Doing geography should not take more than two hours, I presume. Though my
8-page report for 20803 due on Thursday will likely take long and will need to be started
today. Since I am not worried so much about the former, I shall start brainstorming the structure of
this report.

The report should be similar to a proposal. My professor and I have decided that the audience will
be the committee that is in charge of determining the content of the 20803 course or written
communication required credit. I really feel the need to acknowledge the fact that I am only a
college student and that I have no lengthy experience studying the nature of rhetoric and
argumentative writing. Any committee who receives such a report from a student is sure to expect
little, and I would not blame them for this. Also, it should be noted that I am evidently the only
student who seems to have had any sort of trouble with the course. Given that my hypothesis is about
how student seriousness is directly related to perceived difficulty, I guess the lack of consensus
on difficulty could be explained by a lack of seriousness among other classmates. For one thing, I
doubt that the others have cared to look more into the philosophy of rhetoric or to understand
really why they might need to understand the purpose of persuasive arguments. It seems much more
pertinent to the course to just write, and not to focus too hard on \emph{why} you are writing in the first
place. Then again, perhaps the reason is that one wants to graduate and be done with college. This
is not the case for me, thought, as I have come to value my role as a student "sponge," taking each
course with a seriousness about learning that seeks to absorb as much as possible, and that I also
plan to go to graduate school in physics. 

Okay, so is one point going to be that the more seriously one takes the course, the harder that it
becomes to see the point? I don't particularly like this at the moment. I do think that my
difficulties with the course stemmed quite directly from some ideas which surround the philosophy
behind mindfulness, or mindfulness meditation. Recognizing that the words to follow are quite
fluffy, it seems to be a kind of self-awareness that has prevented me from accepting the prospect of
argumentative writing wholeheartedly (or at least from understanding it). When I think to write, I
generally think quite seriously about the idea that another human may end up on the receiving end of
my work. \emph{Arguing} some point, that is to say that I am correct about something, perhaps betrays the
notion that I am at all times fallible. Such a notion seems to have come out of my experience with
mindfulness meditation, if not at least causing better recognition of it. Sometimes I wonder if I
have been averse to my capability of holding conceit starting when I was a child. I did manage some
sort of mental transformation in my coming of age, just before high school. Starting then to ask
more questions about the world and to eventually find tremendous fascination with music, technology,
science, and life in general. Perhaps it was a sort of "rediscovery of wonder" - such is the phrase
that comes to mind. 

Now, I couldn't have expected myself to say these things about myself without acknowledging that I
have in no way convinced myself of having reached some moral high-ground or enlightenment.
Nonetheless, relating this back to the assignment that I have agreed to complete, I figure I must
have some general understand for the type of student that I am. Intentional? Motivated? My professor
seems to have indicated already that I am a student who really cares about the topic, though I think
it more accurate to say that I simply care more about learning and the university environment in
general. Though I am working on letting this show in all of my wakeful hours, I do seem to have
found an intense admiration, appreciation, and motivation toward being alive. As I shake my head in
disbelief toward my own certainty in this idea, learning is quintessential to life. The logic is
perhaps straightforward in that my audience will with no doubt agree in the primacy of
learning. Specifically, I intend to address the notions of learning procedurally and learning for
understanding. Not only asking what I might need to learn, but also \emph{how} I could be learning. My
professor has also said this in class, hoping to teach us "how to learn."

Reviewing what I have thought of so far, I have that I should be able to describe the kind of
student that I am. This student I might describe as being a nerd, a learner, enthusiastic about
school, or something of the sort. I know that I seek to believe as many true things and as few false
things as possible, while also trying to connect with other people in new, deep and insightful
ways. This inevitably includes my professors, though I don't think this point is quite
relevant. What I am perhaps trying to say is that I genuinely look at each class that I take as an
important way of understanding the world. Cultural geography, for one, has shown itself to be a
cause for change in the way I think about my drives around Fort Worth, wonder in every gaze upon a
particular style of architecture or of a weather-beaten building from a past time and culture, (not
to mention the effects of globalization). Anyways, I take each class to be an opportunity to learn
something that I did not know before. What an obvious statement to make about a university. And yet
it strikes me, too, that it is not entirely common for students to have fully embraced this
idea. That they might be learning something that they once did not know. There can be no honest
attempt to understand what is going to be taught in a course before taking it, because you do not
know the content of the course. Such is the reason that you are at the university in the first
place! \emph{You don't know what you don't know}, is what I think of. Or, to be more precise, I mean that
as students it is easy to prepare a little section of your brain for the knowledge you are going to
receive, based on your impressions of what it will be. Would it be ideal then to guide the
information into this structure you have created, or to say simply "I don't know," and be fully open to
surprise.

My thoughts on the idea of claiming to know what you don't know aren't perhaps developed with regard
to the classroom, though as I type this sentence I am seeing connections even to my thoughts on religion
and other things. Intellectual humility seems to keep coming up in these topics, it sure appears to
be close to the "central node." Again, to recap, I think it would be relevant to describe myself as
an open-minded student, perhaps one who feels he has understood the importance of doubting all
things and being aware of his own gaps in understanding. "Self-correcting" maybe a better, more
concise term. Most importantly to this project I tend to require that I understand things to a
sufficient level prior to acting or believing in them, where measuring this level of understanding has
been only possible in deep conversation with others. Striving to understand an idea or situation and not
simply trying to agree with others. Being able to explain my own thought processes has become
important, especially with the requirement that they are indeed \emph{my own}. If they were not my own,
then I would not be measuring my level of understanding but someone else's instead. This would not
be \emph{learning}. Of course I will not be able to say all of this about myself in the op-ed, only a brief
contextual description. Most of the ideas here are developed, I'd say, so I think it would be good
to move on to the points to be made about the course.

My first idea is to introduce the situation chronologically. I entered the class with vague notions
of "postmodernism" and confusion from my other previous two English courses. I was skeptical about
Helms' teaching style, though saw a lot of meaning in the idea of argument as a non-negative
activity. I wound up in a group which was to argue collectively about the injustices of TCU's meal
plan system. I remember thinking that I had terribly low interest in doing this, in addition to
having spent time analyzing countless arguments about religion, skepticism, philosophy and politics
(thanks to Street Epistemology and the "Intellectual dark web"). I found it to be a great
opportunity, and possibly thinking that it might turn out to be easier, to focus on arguing about
something that was important. 

As the course went on, however, I found myself struggling more and more in expressing my opinions
through writing. My stance would continually change while researching and reading up on the
differing perspectives on the topic of free speech in America. It eventually came to questioning
what it even means to hold an opinion, or really what it means to persuade someone to agree with
your opinion. All I knew at the time was that I wasn't too keen on the apparent intentions of
Dr. Helms, and that I did not feel justified in creating a piece of writing with the intention of
changing someone's mind. 

What does it mean to change someone's mind, then? To persuade, to convince, to do what arguments are
designed to do (at least in the way that the textbook presents it)? How sure of my own view do I
have to be before I decide that it would be alright to try and persuade others to agree? This is the
core of the issue that I was able to identify. I had a deep-seeded issue with the prospect of
setting out to change someone's mind. It seemed that in order to rationally have this goal, I would
need to have steadfast confidence in my own opinion and/or ignorance of my own fallibility. So long
as I might be mistaken, who is to say that my ideas are any better than someone else's? Maybe you
shouldn't listen to my opinion because I am just a college student, what do I really know?

And thus I had thrust myself into the realm of epistemology. Already having accepted my fate in the
wise words of Feynman, who I still adore, "Some people say, how can you live without knowing? I do
not know what they mean. I always live without knowing. That is easy. How you get to know is what I
want to know." Of course, with care to avoid the paradox of having certainty in the idea of
uncertainty; skeptical of my own skepticism, one might say. Having already reserved my ability to
doubt all things, I naturally began to doubt myself and my own opinions with regards to my
argumentative writing. It might not be the most persuasive way to argue something, doubting the very
thing that you are tasked to persuade people of. 

Here, I think, could be my first contention with the nature of the course: that there seems little
room allowed for doubt. An argument against this, and evidently the first that I heard, could be
just not to take it \emph{that} seriously. Those less interested seem readily able to submit writing which
makes no real effort to correspond with their own reasoning. This seems even to be encouraged by the
textbook that we had been assigned, especially in its presentation of the Toulmin strategy. To be
more clear, I guess that the course favors those who do not doubt their own reasoning. It may be
that someone is less interested and thus spends less time worrying about the accuracy of their
writing, and/or that the student has not experienced the benefits of doubt and still associates it
with negativity or fear. In either case, this student appears to be in a better situation than one
who insists on doubting himself.

I do not plan to argue the benefits of doubt, nor the righteousness of scientific skepticism, though
I wonder if simply discriminating against those who doubt is grounds enough for change. Perhaps
instead of discrimination it is more of a pressure toward certainty? Not even that, I think, this
appears to lie in what Dr. Helms said about the textbook which may well be true about the course
itself: that there is an assumed goal to change people's minds (or, to persuade). What would happen,
then, to a student who has spiritually (for lack of a better word) come to the decision that he
should in fact question everything, including himself? It would not come easy to him, then, to have
confidence in his own rightness about a controversial issue. If he is a human, and those who read
his writing are human, and he would like to do onto others as he would want them to do unto him,
then he may be faced with a deep moral dilemma. To attempt or not to attempt to persuade? 

Now is about where it would be very useful to define, or to have already defined, the differences
between convincing, persuading and explaining. The first two are assumed to have the goal of
changing someone's mind, where convincing moves a reader to an opinion, and persuasion moves an
opinionated reader to action. Explaining is the most broad of these, it seems. In the way that I am
inclined to use the term "explain," it carries a goal not of \emph{winning} or changing minds, but of being
properly understood. I explained this thinking to Dr. Helms earlier today and it seemed to be cogent
that when it comes to \emph{understanding} and \emph{agreement}, there are four possible rhetorical situations,
each a permutation of the binaries of being understood and being in agreement. Now the question is,
which of these is the most desirable? Or, to take from our previous conversation, a better question
might be to ask if one outcome should precede the other? 

More to the point, I think that one should not be concerned with agreement if a mutual understanding
is not met first. Like the Rogerian argument, understanding now becomes more a more central goal,
instead of agreement or changing one's mind. One potentially good point to make would be to
distinguish between the two cases in which agreement occurs. When we say that we would like to
persuade the reader to agree, must it also be said that we are trying to also convey an
understanding? Which comes first? Try and just get the reader to agree? Or, try and get the reader
to understand first, and then \emph{if your argument makes sense} to the reader, they might agree? It seems
dangerous to ignore the situation that is known all to well, where someone is persuaded to agree but
is not able to accurately explain the very argument which has caused their persuasion. The contrast
of judging and argument by its conclusion, or its reverse, a conclusion by its argument, seems
awfully relevant as well. This important case to consider might well be described in saying that
sometimes the reader will judge an argument by its conclusion, and not the other way around as it
should be.

Relating this idea back to the concept of doubt, I think that the doubting individuals are naturally
inclined to seek only those conclusions which have good arguments. In this situation, as is the
situation that I seem to have found myself in, the expectations of the student and that of 20803 may
no longer be compatible. Being a reader, the skeptic has no problem evaluating arguments. Being the
writer, however, in doubt of his own thoughts the skeptic is compelled by simple moral principles to
avoid misleading the reader and thus to avoid convincing another of his position. After all, he has
not even convinced himself that his opinion is true - only that at present it is his best guess.o
