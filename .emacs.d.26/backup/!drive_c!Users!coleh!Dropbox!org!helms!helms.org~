**** Rhetoric
- "Rhetoric is the ability in each particular case to discover the
  available means of persuasion."
- "Rhetoric is a mode of altering reality, not by the direct
  application of energy to objects, but by the creation of discourse
  which changes reality through the mediation of thought and action."
- "The use of words by human agents to form attitudes or induce
  actions in other human agents."
- "The use of language as a symbolic means of inducing cooperation in
  beings that by nature respond to symbols."

**** Freewrite
- "What about this class excites you most?"

It was very pleasing to hear that grades will be argued for. This is
something that sounds very confortable to me. Having a smaller class
size is also interesting, as it seems it may allow for more involved
discussions or arguments.

- "What about this class scares you most?"

English courses in general tend to scare me a tad, in that the learning outcomes for 
some previously taken did not seem to explicitly stated -- unecessary ambiguity. 
**** Why We Make Arguments
I like this idea of argumentation, as a non-negative activity.
