- A metanarrative is still a narrative, Dave, and we don't like narratives

- You boast having diverse political opinions (great!)

- You tell us to think for ourselves (okay!)

- You say the mainstream is wrong and a load of crap (chill, bro)

- You say look, the IDW is getting popular, yay! (that doesn't matter tho)

- You say you think that we are on to something, media is going to crash and burn haha! (maybe, maybe not?)

- You tell us that we are part of the IDW just like you are! (Yes that's true, and ok cool...)

- You say okay now go share posts and tweet and fight for what you believe! Freethinkers unite! (nah, fam)


- Personal statement / relevance of topic 
- introduce Rubin and the IDW
- state Rubin's central claim and supporting ideas
- transition

One of the most important concepts that I have come to know about
myself during my experience as a university student is that as a human
being, I can sometimes be completely, doggedly, and unwittingly wrong
about the world. From the trials of a pursuing a degree in hard
science to the many good-faith political and religious disputes among
roommates, I've learned of a tremendous value in not just the ability
recognize one's own faults, but in actually going out and searching
actively for other ways in which I may be mistaken about a thing. Such
has led me to question just about everything about my upbringing, the
mainstream, and what others have told me is important, while
simultaneously fueling my dependence on the experience of others,
especially of that on Internet, as a means for testing whatever I
believe to be true and correcting for ignorance. This situation, it
seems, could apply for many others who today find themselves in what's
questionably called the Intellectual Dark Web.

The Intellectual Dark Web, according to Bari Weiss' op-ed in the New
York Times, "is a collection of iconoclastic thinkers, academic
renegades and media personalities who are having a rolling
conversation — on podcasts, YouTube and Twitter, and in sold-out
auditoriums — that sound unlike anything else happening, at least
publicly, in the culture right now" 

One of these personalities that has been gaining traction on YouTube
is Dave Rubin, host of the talk show and podcast, The Rubin Report,
where he often interviews various controversial figures from a wide
range of political and religious backgrounds. Occasionally, The Rubin
Report uploads a Direct Message segment where Rubin engages in a
monologue with his audience, expressing his own thoughts and personal
views cite:wikirr. In one of these segments published in January of this year,
Rubin seems to have made an attempt to address this interesting new
phrase that had emerged, before Weiss' more popular coverage which
came in May. The upload, entitled "What is The Intellectual Dark Web?"
in which Rubin openly chastises the mainstream media for its narrative
focus and general unwillingness to have important conversations, Rubin
urges us as listeners to share the IDW, help the mainstream /wake up/,
and to fight for the ability to disagree publicly in defiance of
authoritarianism cite:video. In doing so, it has become questionable whether or
not The Rubin Report has started to /become the very thing it swore to
destroy/. Relying heavily on the acceptance of broad anti-media
generalizations, emotional appeal, and a legitimizing /metanarrative/,
the less skeptical followers of Rubin and the IDW movement may in fact
be approaching a position that has no more real autonomy than that of
what they might so eagerly oppose.

Right from the start of his address, Rubin makes an explicit focus on
his most loyal fans, insisting twice that "If you've been watching the
show for a while, you know that..." and going on to state his opinions
and positions. Not only does he call the direct attention of those who
are most invested, he also tacitly assumes, thereby causing pressure,
that his broad and evocative claims about political ideals and the
mainstream are understood. Such claims include that the mainstream
has "a stranglehold on your ability to think clearly," argues about
"endless minutiae... instead of arming you with real knowledge and
ideas," and that "almost nothing of real value is happening anywhere
in mainstream media." Rubin does take some care in his beginning
remarks, generously offering us a choice on government: "you're either
for your own determination, or you want to hand it off to someone
else." If we really are to be sold this notion of autonomy, surely
there must be a better way to argue it than to require first that the
listener submit his freedom in accepting the validity of this dilemma.

Another point to be made here is that he seems to be criticizing a
style of reporting that relies on the preservation of a specific
/narrative/, as opposed to seeking truth which he has spoken about
specifically in several interviews. Yet, in his tirade on the
stubbornness of the mainstream, Rubin seems to have missed his entire
point; He instead concocts a sort of narrative /about/ those narratives,
claiming the side of free thinking, questioning authority and the
protection of free speech, while perhaps simultaneously influencing
others to do the opposite. To claim that the mainstream media "is
crumbling at an incredible rate" in this guise may very well seem
victorious, setting a dangerous precedent for discourse with potential
`mainstream-ers'.

Having clearly, albeit baldly, expressed his problems with the current
system, Rubin then goes on to express his thoughts on the Intellectual
Dark Web and future discourse. Here he repeats an idea mentioned at
the start of the monologue: that the IDW is made up of no real
consensus in political or religious opinion. He cites Ben Shapiro,
Jordan Peterson and Sam Harris
