\item The Rubin Report is trying to unite the people of the "Intellectual Dark Web"

\subsection{Trying out Claims}
\label{sec:orgc601e04}

\begin{itemize}
\item Perhaps scared by the current state of free speech in America,
todays most controversial thinkers have begun to turn to a budding
corner of the Internet given the name "The Intellectual Dark Web."

\item A YouTube channel known as The Rubin Report has now perhaps
identified itself as the center of the "Intellectual Dark Web."

\item Millions are listening in on what's going on in the Intellectual
Dark Web.

\item Who are these characters and why should we listen to them?

\item The Rubin Report seems to have taken center stage in the new
"Intellectual Dark Web" phenomenon.
\end{itemize}
