\section{The Rubin Report}
\label{sec:org1d930f8}

``The Rubin Report is a political news talk show currently airing on
YouTube, hosted by Dave Rubin. In The Rubin Report, Rubin interviews
authors, activists, journalists, comedians, actors, and
professors. From 2013 to 2015, The Rubin Report featured a panel of
two guests and covered weekly news stories. After launching on Ora TV
in 2015, the show took a more focused approach on the big ideas
relating to politics and religion, as well as a focus on one on one
interviews and monologues from Rubin. The following is a transcript
taken from YouTube's closed captioning sevice of a Direct Message
video segment by The Rubin Report, entitled: \href{https://youtu.be/n5HN-KT9rj0}{`What is the Intellectual
Dark Web?'(link)} , including my own edits made only for spacing,
capitalization and punctuation.

The Direct Message segment is a monologue delivered by Rubin that
opens each episode of The Rubin Report. The segment features Rubin's
personal views on the topic that will be discussed with the guest or
panel in that episode.`` \cite{wikirubin}

\section{Transcript}
\label{sec:orge8212c8}
\begin{center}
\large What is the Intellectual Dark Web? \cite{rubinrepidw}
\end{center}

``If you've been watching the show for a while, you know that
some of my favorite guests include people who are firmly on the
political left such as Sam Harris, Brett Weinstein, and Eric Weinstein,
some people who are on the political right such as Ben Shapiro, Dennis
Prager, and Larry Elder, as well as some people who are hard to place on
the conventional spectrum such as Jordan Peterson, Phil DeFranco and
Brandon O'Neil.

Of course if you've been watching for a while you also
know that I think that the left-right paradigm of politics is becoming
increasingly meaningless and the new more relevant spectrum is one of
personal freedom versus state power. You're either for a society based
on laws which treat individual people equally with minimal involvement
from the government in their day-to-day lives, or you prefer a society
which treats certain groups differently based on immutable
characteristics and thus the government must play a major role in
whether they succeed or fail. The simplest way to say this is: you're
either for your own determination, or you want to hand it off to
someone else.

If I've changed on anything in the past few years, it's that I
consistently find myself agreeing with people who fight for individual
choice over governmental authority. If you watch cable news or really
listen to any of the mainstream media, this conversation about your
ability to live your life as you see fit, which I believe to be the
most important conversation happening right now, is barely happening
at all. 

Actually I believe almost nothing of real value is happening anywhere
in mainstream media. Cable news is force feeding you an endless
back-and-forth by pundits who consistently get everything wrong
(remember Hillary's 99\% chance of winning in 2016) while at the same
time they mask their opinions as facts and argue about the endless
minutiae of a broken Washington DC instead of arming you with real
knowledge and new ideas.

I don't know that there's anyone specifically to blame for this other
than the mainstream media is based on an old dying model that is being
replaced by new media and new technology so quickly, that its faults
are becoming glaringly obvious. Fortunately thanks to youtube,
podcasting and however else you get shows like this one, the
mainstream media's stranglehold on information, which really is a
stranglehold on your ability to think clearly about the issues of the
day, is crumbling at an incredible rate. Now the question is who and
what will replace it?

A few months ago one of my favorite people to sit across this table
from Eric Weinstein came up with the phrase ``Intellectual Dark Web'' to
describe this eclectic mix of people from Sam Harris to Ben Shapiro to
his brother Brett Weinstein to Jordan Peterson all of whom are
figuring out ways to have the important and often dangerous
conversations that are completely ignored by the mainstream. It's why
I would argue that this collection of people are actually more
influential at this point than whatever collection of cable news
pundits you can come up with and it's not just those names I mentioned
above but people like Joe Rogan who's absolutely killing it on his
podcast every week it's people like Christina Hoff Sommers who's
fighting the intersectionality of third wave feminism while still
holding hope for feminism's original ambitions of equality of
opportunity. It's also people like James d'amour and Lindsey Shepard
who are fighting for the true diversity of ideas at Google and at
universities. This wide tent of people we're talking about have
tremendous political differences when it comes to taxes, abortion,
foreign policy and more, but we've all committed ourselves to fighting
for our ideas honestly and passionately, but more importantly than
that we've committed to the open exchange of ideas and not silencing
our opponents no matter how many times they refuse to extend that same
courtesy to us.

If you think I'm being hyperbolic about the growing influence of this
group just check the traction that these people get on Twitter or
Facebook compared to our mainstream competitors. Twitter may not be
real life as I say in my Twitter bio but it is some barometer of what
the zeitgeist is right now. Not only will the numbers stand on their
own, but when you realize that the mainstream people we're talking
about have massive amounts of money and influence behind them, and all
most of us have is grassroots support from people like you, you can
really see what's happening here. Even look at this very show we've
come together because we're fighting for our ability to agree to
disagree before it's taken away from us.

Last year I talked about a new center in politics, a place where
liberals, libertarians, conservatives, anyone who wanted to fight
authoritarianism, could put aside their differences and come together
to find some new solutions as we watch our old institutions of
politics and media crumble. I now realize that the answer I was
looking for wasn't purely political, but really cultural as
well. There's something else happening here that we all kind of know
but we haven't been able to totally define. It's why you watching this
right now are actually part of this Intellectual Dark Web. If you
engage with these ideas and you're trying to figure out what the hell
is going on, then you are as much part of this thing as I am. The more
you tweet, share posts, and get out there and fight for what you
believe, the more space that we have to continue to do whatever it is
each of us are doing.

There are markers where some of this breaks through to the mainstream
such as Ben Affleck's gross and racist comment hurled at Sam Harris,
or when Ben Shapiro smackdown piers morgan about guns on CNN, or just
this past week when Jordan Peterson calmly dissected an interviewer
who was trying to paint him as an extremist for defending free
speech. I suspect there will be many more moments like that this year
because the mainstream is finally picking up on what you and I already
see. As I said at the beginning of the year I believe 2018 will be the year
of unusual alliances and this new Intellectual Dark Web will be at the
forefront of that movement.

Tomorrow I'll be in studio with two of those guys, Ben Shapiro and
Jordan Peterson, and I fully expect to crash the internet - or at
least get demonetised by YouTube.`` \\

\subsection{Formulating A Claim}
\label{sec:org9027cc1}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Rubin Report is trying to unite the people of the ``Intellectual Dark Web''
\item The message is directed toward his subscribers and frequent viewers
\item Stats on \textit{<06/12/18 Tue>} show 141,374 views, 8.2K likes and 325 dislikes
\item It seems that Ethos of free speech is the most important part of the argument
\item Doesn't spend a lot of time establishing credibility (to subscribers)
\item Highlights his personal political philosophy
\item States a main problem, mainstream media is dishonest, forces against free speech

\item Dave Rubin is passionate?

\item Trying to persuade people to participate in the new IDW.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Trying out Claims}
\label{sec:org0f261d3}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Claims which are too broad:
\label{sec:orgb875162}
\begin{itemize}
\item Perhaps scared by the current state of free speech in America,
todays most controversial thinkers have begun to turn to a budding
corner of the Internet given the name ``The Intellectual Dark Web.''

\item A YouTube channel known as The Rubin Report has now perhaps
identified itself as the center of the ``Intellectual Dark Web.''

\item Millions are listening in on what's going on in the Intellectual
Dark Web.

\item Who are these characters and why should we listen to them?

\item The Rubin Report seems to have taken center stage in the new
``Intellectual Dark Web'' phenomenon.

\item Free speech and honest discussion in today's mainstream media
\end{itemize}

IDW has formed to escape the sensational narratives created by the mainstream media. 
The Rubin Report is an emerging part of this area of the internet.
Are Rubin's direct messages hepling to facilitate the nuanced and anti-narrative approach?

Many people appreciate and subscribe to the IDW for it's emphasis on
providing long nuanced discussion of difficult topics via the
internet.

One such outlet has been The Rubin Report, where Dave Rubin
frequently uploads interviews and mediated discussions between various
controversial figures.

The IDW has attracted people skeptical of mainstream media, trying to escape confirmation bias.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Rambling}
\label{sec:orge92db65}

Today I have elected to turn in my english rhetorical analysis
assignment by the end of the day, though I have not actually started
writing the 1800 words. Must work on something now, but what?  ``By the
end of the day'' would definitely suggest that I would be turning the
paper in before midnight\ldots{} but I don't imagine that my professor is
still awake at this time and I may as well have until the morning so I
may stay up all night and get this done. Focus on the rhetorical
analysis paper that will analyze Dave Rubin's argument style in his
internet address of the Intellectual Dark Web. The group of people and
style of conversation definitely seems to be a kind of deep thinking,
though the word ``Intellectual'' does also seem to bug me.

Who gets to say, really, who is an intellectual? Is this just a
scholar? A smart person? Intelligence, I presume is relevant. I still
am of the thought that no one really known what constitutes
intelligence, seeing as we are still coming up with better ways to
construct artificial intelligence. ``If I cannot make it, then I do not
understand it,'' is a saying that comes to mind which may apply to the
current situation with regards to humans' understanding of
intelligence. I want to say that Feynman was the one who said this,
though I am also fairly certain that the quote is not exactly the way
he said it.

I have gotten side-tracked, perhaps? The rhetorical analysis, yes. Off
the top of my head, I remember Rubin coming across as quite passionate
about his viewpoint. This is alright insofar as he acknowledges that
it is not \emph{the} viewpoint, which from his other podcasts and shows, it
seems he has done a good job. Best shown in this address, however, is
perhaps where he mentions how his political stance has changed in a
number of ways. From the left more toward the right, in his case,
generally speaking, but also toward strong defense of the principle of
free speech. Here is where I anticipate the highest amount of public
controversy. The question, ``At what point does someone's right to
freedom of speech trump another person's right not to be offended?''
the answer to which would certainly correlate with one's perception of
the whole Intellectual Dark Web movement. 

I think that I need to put more of my thoughts down onto my laptop, as
I am doing now. I think also that I have been a slow writer
recently. Not so sure that this is necessarily a bad thing, though I
also think that there is some truth to the idea that one does not
usually sit down with a blank document and start writing any piece in
the way that it will be when it is finished. Outlining seems to be of
great help, generalizing a topic into main categories and then into
themes or the most important ideas involved. Then, expanding each
point in a sort of tree, like fashion until the writing is at an
appropriate level of detail. This is to be contrasted with just
beginning at the final level of detail, not having any indication as
to how long the writing may end up being if the writer is to keep said
level of detail throughout all of the paper. Thus, it seems more
vulnerable to inconsistencies and possibly getting side-tracked into
irrelevant conversation. Losing sight of the big picture would be a
good way to say what I mean. 

So alright, lets see what kinds of topics I will be covering. The
``mind map'' technique as discussed in class for the op-ed might also be
a great way to structure this analysis writing. The main focus here
being the specific argument of one stakeholder, Dave Rubin. Perhaps it
is more of an attitude of ``here is this issue that I am curious about
and this person seems to have something to say about it - what is he
saying and why might I be inclined to believe him?'' This question is
hard to phrase, considering that our professor has stated on multiple
occasions that the analysis claim be about the \emph{nature} of the stake
holder's argument on the issue, \textbf{not} about the issue itself. In the
simplest terms I can imagine, ``why should I listen to [stakeholder]?''
is the question that it seems we are trying to answer. Though this is
perhaps too broad in the sense that the focus should be just on the
argument that is being made (from the specific source
mentioned). Nonetheless, I like this approach as it is very relevant
in researching and forming an opinion on the issue, hearing what others
are saying and how they are saying it.

\begin{itemize}
\item Free Speech is the largest topic
\item Intellectual Dark Web is the subtopic
\item The Rubin Report is the stakeholder
\item YouTube is the media platform / communication medium
\end{itemize}

At what point does one's right to freedom of speech trump one's right
not to be offended?

\begin{itemize}
\item Free Speech vs. Hate speech debate?
\item Wikipedia, ``fighting words''
\item What is protected under the U.S. law?
\end{itemize}

While the question is a rather controversial one, this could be the
main issue for my project: situations in which one feels that by being
honest and expressing one's opinion, in good faith, one is at risk of
offending the person that is to be spoken to.

I imagine the situation in which I have been born and raised in Nazi
Germany in a family and community which supports the Nazi
regime. Suppose I meet an outsider at a coffee shop and begin talking
to them about life. Suppose also that this person is Jewish, and that
I think Jewish people are evil and deserving of death based solely on
the fact that they identify as a Jew. One major thing to note here is
that, if we also suppose that I am of the mind that \emph{cares} whether or
not it is true that Jews are deserving of death - that is to say that,
I am a unique kind of Nazi who believes in what he has been told
insofar as this is all he has known, and that this is his best guess
as to how to act in the world (and I suppose I am changing
perspectives) - if the Nazi were to tell the Jew that he thinks Jews
should die, this would surely cause a great deal of distress and bring
offensiveness. My question is, how would said Nazi be able to change
his mind out of some radical position if no one allows him to state
his position aloud? What if no one is there to hear his reasoning and
try to correct his errors of judgment? It seems that he would instead
be likely to face immediate retaliation with no explanation as to why
his opponents are responding in this way.

Such seems tragic as everyone involved may be doing only what he/she
believes is correct, though ultimately there should surely be no
tolerance for an opinion that wishes the death of another human. Such
is to use freedom of expression to advocate the suppression of
expression of another individual. Life seems as good an unalienable
right as any, but what about freedom of expression? What is a good
policy to take when someone is using their freedom of speech to
interfere with someone else's freedom of speech? ``I think that you
shouldn't be able to say that'' is a basic way of putting this, and it
sounds an awful lot like the words of someone who may have just been
offended. It seems identical to saying ``I think this person's speech should
not be protected under the law.''

An interesting thing to point out is also that any speech is
ultimately subject to certain consequences, not just legal. If someone
wants to fire someone for posting that their boss is a bitch to
Facebook, certainly this is acceptable. For Sam Harris, who states
frequently that it is important to be able to criticize bad ideas,
what consequences should come of the opinion that Islam is the mother
load of bad ideas? This is not to say that Muslims should be killed,
of course - nothing at all about Muslims as human beings. The idea,
however, that Muhammad is the final messiah and son of God and that
the Koran contains the infallible word of god, (which indicates that
certain members of a society are deserving of death), is argued to be
one that should not be respected, perhaps? What do we mean by saying
``I do not like this idea.'' Should we get rid of the idea? Death to an
idea?  Or advocation against the idea of Islam, perhaps? Being able to
argue against it publicly so as to offer reasons not to become a
Muslim and let those who read decide whether or not this is
convincing? I think yes, this is what is meant by holding an
opposition to an idea. It is only to say that ``I think there are good
reasons for \emph{not} believing in Islam,'' for example in this situation. It
is a rather harmless statement of opinion, it seems. ``I think it is a
bad idea'' turns into ``I think I can convince you not to become a
Muslim''

I wonder if the controversy surrounding a phobia of Islam arises from
the ambiguity of being a Muslim. The Koran might explicitly instruct
believers to kill those who have turned their back on Allah, in which
case we must know what is to be interpreted by someone identifying as
Muslim? Is this equivalent to saying that one wishes death upon
nonbelievers? Perhaps a clarification need to be made on a massive
scale for the community of Muslims, thereby forcing those who wish
death to be recognized and potentially face conflicts under the law
should they not reevaluate their beliefs. Meanwhile, it should be
encouraged that the Muslim community do this, if any of what I have
said here has any correspondence with reality.

I have, of course, gone way off topic here, I'm afraid. While my
thoughts on the idea of free speech are more clear, I must still
evaluate the argument style in Rubin's video. Let the all-nighter
begin.

\subsection{Rubin's Claims}
\label{sec:org60ba741}

\begin{quote}
``As I said at the beginning of the
year I believe 2018 will be the year of unusual alliances and this new
Intellectual Dark Web will be at the forefront of that movement.''
\end{quote}

The Intellectual Dark Web is revolutionizing the way we talk about politics.

As a place which values free speech and the open exchange of ideas,
the IDW 

The Intellectual Dark Web is the place to be if you want to understand
what is going on in politics.

Emphasizes the importance of his own viewership?

The more and more I think about this the more that Rubin seems just
like another news anchor for a media company.

Boasts the inclusion of diverse political viewpoints on his show, yet
also seems to create the narrative that excludes the methods of the
mainstream media.

\begin{quote}
``\ldots{}a new center in politics, a place where
liberals, libertarians, conservatives, anyone who wanted to fight
authoritarianism, could put aside their differences and come together
to find some new solutions as we watch our old institutions of
politics and media crumble.''
\end{quote}

Basically the IDW is the next step in the evolution of political commentary and coverage?

His argument is that the mainstream media sucks ass and that the IDW
is \emph{where it's at}. (?)

\subsubsection{Outlining the arguments of his video}
\label{sec:org9cf488c}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Rubin Report boasts inclusion of many diverse opinions
\item Massive either-or distinction and deliberate straw-man?
\item Statement of support of individual choice
\item Nothing of value is coming from the mainstream media; methods are outdated
\item The mainstream media exercises authority over the information that
you see, instead of respecting individual freedom, and perhaps
``freethinking''; what will replace it?
\item Having the important and dangerous conversations which mainstream ignores
\item Committed to good faith arguments and the open exchange of ideas; anti-censorship
\item The IDW is focusing on people who are actually relevant in todays
politics (cites Twitter)
\item Popularity shifting to internet despite disproportionate funding;
emphasizes strength of movement (bandwagon?)
\item We, the IDW are a new center in politics where \emph{you're} in control!
\item \emph{Look at us go, we are so smart; the mainstream will catch up one day}
\item IDW at the forefront of the ``year of unusual alliances''
\end{itemize}

It's like an advertisement for The Rubin Report using the banner of the IDW?
The IDW exemplifies the future of political discourse,
like he's a post-truth savior. ``The Intellectual Dark Web: freethinkers haven of information''

\subsubsection{\emph{Really} Outlining the arguments of his video}
\label{sec:org0188ceb}

Trying to avoid falling for bandwagon appeals; heretical, nonconformist, freethinkers
Conversation vs. violence, the business of exposing taboos

Seems like Rubin is trying to
\begin{itemize}
\item say that there is \emph{something going on} in the IDW; the next big thing in political discourse
\item explain feelings that drove the formation of the IDW, free speech concerns
\item make audience feel like a community; a part of something good
\end{itemize}

What is the intellectual dark web and why is it here?

A message to his audience that encourages awareness of what they are participating in?

\begin{enumerate}
\item I NEARLY MISSED THE POINT (this will work for the op-ed):
\label{sec:orga30e256}

The bias present in the video helps show that perhaps the IDW really is a good thing.
Speaks of the diversity of opinion in the IDW (while providing his own opinion).

Overall topic question: Is the Intellectual Dark Web on to something? Should we be taking notes? (``Should we be listening?'' -- Bari Weiss)

Should we be listening to the Intellectual Dark Web?
Can we learn something valuable from the Intellectual Dark Web?
What the big deal about the Intellectual Dark Web?

Rubin's position: Yes, the Intellectual Dark Web is the place to be.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Analysis}
\label{sec:org43c39b3}

I have finally found a better way to state the larger problem at hand,
that is the public issue of the ``splinternet.'' Causes for the issue
may be rampant confirmation bias and the dependence on clickbait or
sensational journalism? Because of this, media consumers develop a
sensitivity to ideas which conflict with their own that the media has
so graciously protected. Finally, once the academics and thinkers come
to have interviews on mainstream media, the sensitivity becomes
overbearing and interviews turn into professional straw-man
competitions and childish ad hominem fits, lending barely any time for
the opposition to properly explain a position. Thus, the
academics/intellectuals/thinkers flock to a corner of the internet (or
a part of the internet flocks around them) and born is the place known
as the Intellectual Dark Web. 

The rhetorical analysis here is then assesing Rubin's solution to the
issue of the current polarized climate, which is clearly the idea of
good faith free speech. Specifically with emphasis on the idea that
free speech extends not just to those people who you agree with, but
to those who disagree and even those who might offend you. In this
video, Rubin addresses his audience of YouTube subscribers the
potential of the IDW to turn the tides of the mainstream towards a
more bona fide search for truth \cite{rubinrepidw}.
