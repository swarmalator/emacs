"The Rubin Report is a political news talk show currently airing on
YouTube, hosted by Dave Rubin. In The Rubin Report, Rubin interviews
authors, activists, journalists, comedians, actors, and
professors. From 2013 to 2015, The Rubin Report featured a panel of
two guests and covered weekly news stories. After launching on Ora TV
in 2015, the show took a more focused approach on the big ideas
relating to politics and religion, as well as a focus on one on one
interviews and monologues from Rubin. The following is a transcript
taken from YouTube's closed captioning sevice of a Direct Message
video segment by The Rubin Report, entitled: [[https://youtu.be/n5HN-KT9rj0]['What is the Intellectual
Dark Web?']], including my own edits made only for spacing, capitalization and
punctuation.

The Direct Message segment is a monologue delivered by Rubin that
opens each episode of The Rubin Report. The segment features Rubin's
personal views on the topic that will be discussed with the guest or
panel in that episode." cite:wikirubin

"If you've been watching the show for a while, you know that
some of my favorite guests include people who are firmly on the
political left such as Sam Harris, Brett Weinstein, and Eric Weinstein,
some people who are on the political right such as Ben Shapiro, Dennis
Prager, and Larry Elder, as well as some people who are hard to place on
the conventional spectrum such as Jordan Peterson, Phil DeFranco and
Brandon O'Neil. Of course if you've been watching for a while you also
know that I think that the left-right paradigm of politics is becoming
increasingly meaningless and the new more relevant spectrum is one of
personal freedom versus state power. You're either for a society based
on laws which treat individual people equally with minimal involvement
from the government in their day-to-day lives, or you prefer a society
which treats certain groups differently based on immutable
characteristics and thus the government must play a major role in
whether they succeed or fail. The simplest way to say this is: you're
either for your own determination, or you want to hand it off to
someone else.

If I've changed on anything in the past few years, it's
that I consistently find myself agreeing with people who fight for
individual choice over governmental authority. If you watch cable news
or really listen to any of the mainstream media, this conversation
about your ability to live your life as you see fit, which I believe to
be the most important conversation happening right now, is barely
happening at all. Actually I believe almost nothing of real value is
happening anywhere in mainstream media. Cable news is force feeding you
an endless back-and-forth by pundits who consistently get everything
wrong (remember Hillary's 99% chance of winning in 2016) while at the
same time they mask their opinions as facts and argue about the
endless minutiae of a broken Washington DC instead of arming you with
real knowledge and new ideas. I don't know that there's anyone
specifically to blame for this other than the mainstream media is
based on an old dying model that is being replaced by new media and
new technology so quickly, that its faults are becoming glaringly
obvious. Fortunately thanks to youtube, podcasting and however else you
get shows like this one, the mainstream media's stranglehold on
information, which really is a stranglehold on your ability to think
clearly about the issues of the day, is crumbling at an incredible rate.
Now the question is who and what will replace it?

A few months ago one of my favorite people to sit across this table
from Eric Weinstein came up with the phrase "Intellectual Dark Web" to
describe this eclectic mix of people from Sam Harris to Ben Shapiro to
his brother Brett Weinstein to Jordan Peterson all of whom are
figuring out ways to have the important and often dangerous
conversations that are completely ignored by the mainstream. It's why I
would argue that this collection of people are actually more
influential at this point than whatever collection of cable news
pundits you can come up with and it's not just those names I mentioned
above but people like Joe Rogan who's absolutely killing it on his
podcast every week it's people like Christina Hoff Sommers who's
fighting the intersectionality of third wave feminism while still
holding hope for feminism's original ambitions of equality of
opportunity. It's also people like James d'amour and Lindsey Shepard
who are fighting for the true diversity of ideas at Google and at
universities. This wide tent of people we're talking about have
tremendous political differences when it comes to taxes, abortion,
foreign policy and more, but we've all committed ourselves to fighting
for our ideas honestly and passionately, but more importantly than that
we've committed to the open exchange of ideas and not silencing our
opponents no matter how many times they refuse to extend that same
courtesy to us.

If you think I'm being hyperbolic about the growing influence of this
group just check the traction that these people get on Twitter or
Facebook compared to our mainstream competitors. Twitter may not be
real life as I say in my Twitter bio but it is some barometer of what
the zeitgeist is right now. Not only will the numbers stand on their
own, but when you realize that the mainstream people we're talking
about have massive amounts of money and influence behind them, and all
most of us have is grassroots support from people like you, you can
really see what's happening here. Even look at this very show we've
come together because we're fighting for our ability to agree to
disagree before it's taken away from us.

Last year I talked about a new center in politics, a place where
liberals, libertarians, conservatives, anyone who wanted to fight
authoritarianism, could put aside their differences and come together
to find some new solutions as we watch our old institutions of
politics and media crumble. I now realize that the answer I was
looking for wasn't purely political, but really cultural as
well. There's something else happening here that we all kind of know
but we haven't been able to totally define. It's why you watching this
right now are actually part of this Intellectual Dark Web. If you
engage with these ideas and you're trying to figure out what the hell
is going on, then you are as much part of this thing as I am. The more
you tweet, share posts, and get out there and fight for what you
believe, the more space that we have to continue to do whatever it is
each of us are doing. There are markers where some of this breaks
through to the mainstream such as Ben Affleck's gross and racist
comment hurled at Sam Harris, or when Ben Shapiro smackdown piers
morgan about guns on CNN, or just this past week when Jordan Peterson
calmly dissected an interviewer who was trying to paint him as an
extremist for defending free speech. I suspect there will be many more
moments like that this year because the mainstream is finally picking
up on what you and I already see. As I said at the beginning of the
year I believe 2018 will be the year of unusual alliances and this new
Intellectual Dark Web will be at the forefront of that movement.
Tomorrow I'll be in studio with two of those guys, Ben Shapiro and
Jordan Peterson, and I fully expect to crash the internet - or at
least get demonetised by YouTube." \\
