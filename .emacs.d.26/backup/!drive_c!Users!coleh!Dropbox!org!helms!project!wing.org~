One of the most important concepts that I have come to know about
myself during my experience as a university student is that as a human
being, I can sometimes be completely, doggedly, and unwittingly wrong
about the world. My judgments seem to be more clearly vulnerable to
error now than they have ever been. This is something that I seem to
have learned to embrace through the idea of genuine skepticism, while
the act of forming and expressing my own opinions clearly to others
has become a most morally strenuous task.

As I near the end of my time at Texas Christian University, I am also
finding it very hard to remain skeptical while taking a wholehearted
and sincere effort to learn from my final few required courses. In
this year, if all goes well, I will have completed three classes from
the English department at TCU. In the two that I have completed so
far, I have managed to get through them despite intense confusion
surrounding the apparent ideological themes expressed of professors in
these classrooms, bordering on my recognition of a possible deep moral
divergence of outlook on education.

Dr. Helms is a professor in the English department at TCU, with whom I
am currently enrolled in an argumentative writing class (which is
evidently why I am writing this analysis). He has written several
books including an online piece entitled "Rhizcomics," which is a
creative and interactive reading experience which focuses on and
argues after Lyotard and other postmodern ideas including the metaphor
of the rhizome. With the growing controversy that surrounds the
influence of postmodernism among faculty and students of modern
American universities, I have decided to attempt a balanced analysis
of Dr. Helms as a teacher and professor, and to examine the
relationship between his uses of rhetoric and the postmodern
philosophies.

My first encounter with Dr. Helms actually occurred in a different
English course I was taking at TCU. He was invited as a guest speaker,
there to talk about his new online book "Rhizcomics," where he offered
a short view into some of its postmodern themes; I happened to be
taking notes. The first topic, and to me the most important one that
was discussed during his guest lecture, was one referred to as the
"epistem," short for epistemology, commonly understood to be the realm
of philosophy which studies "how we know what we know." In my notes
that I have from earlier this year, I have written that Helms said,
sometimes we "gotta take it on faith" when it comes to /really/ trying
to know everything. To me, this already implies a departure from the
epistemology of the sciences, though still potentially compatible with
that of either religion or some strands of postmodernism.

Next, I have that we also discussed "how history has changed what we
know." As these notes spur the memory that I have of the lecture,
Helms was likely referring to the idea that by looking at past societies,
we are able to better view the decisions of various governing entities
and can more clearly tell whether or not the philosophies that drove
those regimes were ultimately good or for worse. This is has been a
common theme that has come up in my research on the topic of
postmodernism, or more specifically in post-structuralism. In brief, I
have learned that the historically dominant structuralist philosophies
looked to inform their study of the world with a lens focused on the
current time, as opposed to the post-structuralists who are said to be
informed by the historical evidence of past failures and successes in
human policymaking.  Here is where it may be drawn that the latter
seems to align quite literally with Dr. Helms' perspective.

Now we are perhaps onto the more controversial side of the
postmodernist theory, still with regards to my notes of Helms' guest
lecture. A final note that I have on the first section of his talk,
about the philosophical motivations for his writing, is that "things
that are wrong now are invisible to us" and also to "wait for someone
else to tell you it's wrong, b/c [sic] it's invisible." Taking care
not to make false assumptions on what was actually said, what
Dr. Helms appears to have been saying with regards to language and
society is the opinion that we won't really know if a new cultural
philosophy will be successful until we try it. This would definitely
seem to indicate a rejection of some basic structuralist or modernist
views: studying society not through the lens of the current
metanarrative, or the underlying ideologies which are said to exist
only to ensure the rule of the current leading societal groups, but to
study humanity instead based on historical intuitions of certain
policies which have already been tried, leaving open those which have
not yet been fully realized.

Throughout the first three weeks of our argumentative writing course,
Helms has placed significant emphasis on "the value of multicultural
differences," as is stated as a learning objective on the class
syllabus, often specifically mentioned with regards to more general
notions of diversity on campus. One personal and political opinion of
his which has become increasingly apparent is that Texas Christian
University should have more policies which promote a much more diverse
student population, frequently implying a specific preference toward
underrepresented minority groups at TCU. I have taken notes of some
words spoken to the class from Dr. Helms, including two hypothetical
examples of vague argument policy claims: "read an article by someone
who looks different than you," and "hire more professors of color," in
response to the general idea of faculty diversity, which is some of
the students' selected writing topic. On another occasion, Helms asked
students if he had been coming across as particularly one-sided in his
comments about the notion of diversity and administrative choices of
the university. One student responded, openly expressed his approval
of being one-sided with regards to that particular issue. It has been
the continuation of this style of rhetoric throughout that seems to
indicate a clear departure in thought from the enlightenment ideals of
collective objectivity and knowledge construction. In some
circumstances, this may even suggest a lack of respect for the
autonomy of each individual student in his/her own search for meaning,
with the potential to cause distress in those interested explicitly in
learning through the continual achievement of collectively agreeable
understandings.
 
The term "social justice" is commonly associated with postmodern
viewpoints, Michel Foucault being just one example of a politically
active and highly influential postmodern French
philosopher. Dr. Helms, as we may find in the course syllabus and
throughout his publications, is also a firm supporter of the feminist
and LGBT movements, which are of course associated with many outspoken
social justice programs around the country. In our course syllabus he
includes the topic of a "Safe Zone," which outlines Helms' explicit
affirmation of non-binary gender identification, including the
statement, "I will not allow homophobic comments in class." This
indicates Helms' sympathy for a particularly post-structuralist theme
of holding preference for certain marginalized groups, along rhetoric
in his book on "inverting binaries," perhaps with the goal of opposing
the existing mainstream hierarchies and legitimizing metanarratives.

I will now move on to perhaps the most fundamental indicator of
postmodern influence, that which attempts to answer the notion of
"epistem" as mentioned earlier. I understand that one common consensus
between the postmodern thinkers - Foucault, Derrida, Lyotard, Deleuze,
and others - is that there are fundamental ambiguities regarding the
communication of meaning through human language. General skepticism is
practiced toward the existence of an objective "big T" Truth. I have
also gathered that the subjective, or "little t" truth, is the only
sense of truth that is said to ultimately carry any meaning at all,
made best known perhaps by Derrida's assertion, "there is no
outside-text." Though I do not recall this idea being explicitly
addressed by Dr. Helms in class, he does express his own analysis of
the idea in his book, including Lyotard's important discussion and
deconstruction. One particular aspect of this discourse in semiotics
which seems to have manifested itself in the rhetoric of Helms'
teaching is the crucial point made also by Derrida, "any attempt to
fix the gap between signifier and signified is doomed to fail," or
more succinctly in Helms' words, "clarity is a myth."

Seeing as this is not by any stretch a complete rhetorical analysis of
Helms' book "Rhizcomics," only a comparison between teaching rhetoric
and some postmodern ideas, I anticipate needing to better understand
Helms' broader thoughts about the writings of Derrida and
Lyotard. This is perhaps only to say that Helms' position is not
absolutely clear to me. Perhaps, then, clarity in this sense is indeed
a myth. What I then interpret as evidence for this idea in the
classroom has been a general aversion to deeper explanations,
specifically regarding the often specific methods presented on
crafting effective persuasive writing. Like the idea of the "rhizome,"
it seems that each concept in the course material that has been the
focus of certain lectures and assignments contains no clear
theoretical connection to the other topics presented. Instead of one
logically coherent and overarching "tree" structure of knowledge, I
seem to have strained myself, navigating a sort of educational
rhizome, looking for the fundamental unifying concepts that don't seem
to exist.

The educational implications of a more postmodern focus in the
teaching of writing and literature has, to my eye, been observed to a
relevant extent in Dr. Helms' course. As a student in science who has
been accustomed to a more coherent and scientific style of learning, I
am thus very familiar with the experience of class as a means to come
to some rational understanding of one broader topic. The lack of a
clear first principles learning structure and emphasis on personal
versus shared truth in classes like Dr. Helms' has given me great
pause for concern and inquiry toward the new and interesting
postmodernist theory.
