Today we learned the details of how this course will operate, the
expectations between the students and professor, and a recap on
rhetoric. It was nice to meet all of our classmates in a smaller
classroom setting.

Rhetoric
- "Rhetoric is the ability in each particular case to discover the
  available means of persuasion."
- "Rhetoric is a mode of altering reality, not by the direct
  application of energy to objects, but by the creation of discourse
  which changes reality through the mediation of thought and action."
- "The use of words by human agents to form attitudes or induce
  actions in other human agents."
- "The use of language as a symbolic means of inducing cooperation in
  beings that by nature respond to symbols."

Freewrite:
"What about this class excites you most?"
- It was very pleasing to hear that grades will be argued for. This is
  something that sounds very confortable to me. Having a smaller class
  size is also interesting, as it seems it may allow for more involved
  discussions or arguments.

"What about this class scares you most?"
- English courses in general tend to scare me a tad, in that the
  learning outcomes for some previously taken did not seem to
  explicitly stated -- unecessary ambiguity.

Why do we make arguments? I like this idea of argumentation, as a
non-negative activity.
- Ethos
- Pathos
- Logos
- Kairos
- Deliberative (Future)
- Epideictic (Present)
- Forensic (Past)

Thinking about my own capabilities as a reader and writer, it would
seem that I generally have a very difficult time communicating my
thoughts accurately and entirely. To second my girlfriend, I do feel
as though I tend to spend a great deal of time thinking very deeply
about questions. My guess would be that this causes the opinions that
I gather to be riddled with details and nuances that take me a long
time to generalize, or compress into more concise forms, should I be
be asked to express myself.

This being said, I also feel that when I am able to set aside enough
time to collect all of my thoughts on some question, my arguments are
generally quite good, per feedback from others. 

Of course, considering that this response is indeed a situation in
which I must respond to a very broad question, there are many more
experiences that I've had and could delve into as they relate to my
abilites in argumentation and communication. If anything, this is
perhaps to say that I want to communicate the best judgements of
things as possible in all my arguments, acknowledging my own perpetual
fallibility as a human. Since it is always the case that there exists
more to learn and that my thoughts will differ in some way from the
truth, claiming any real knowledge of any one thing for me is
impossble. It follows that any form of criticism of my opinions is a
good thing - an opportunity to rethink my argument - and it is this
kind of socratic and enlightenment style of thinking that I think has
put me in a good position to analyze and commmunicate sound and
informative arguments; but we'll see...

- I did not think so hard about my clothing choices today
- Shorter hair
- Bland clothing, not super regular but not expressive
- humility, modesty, self-effacing
- Not attracting attention

On Wednesday we examined perceptions of ethos statements made by
fashion choices, including a specific class comparison of those made
by Beyonce and Taylor Swift. Later we went over the details of our
group project and the stakeholder analysis part.

- Every team will generate a list of major stakeholders within the
  controversy that your group is studying
- Within your team, each group member will select one stakeholder that
  they will become an expert on, irrespective of your own position on
  the issue
- Each person will:
    - Write a 6-page (1800 words) rhetorical analysis of one
      stakeholder's position, argument, and rhetorical strategies
    - Cite at least one source made by the stakeholder
    - These analyses should strive to provide a fair analysis of your
      stakeholder's position by quoting from and closely engage with
      source /produced/ by those stakeholders.
***** Focus/Purpose/genre
Makes an argument about the stakeholder's use of rhetoric (not about
the issue itself). Clearly identifies a stakeholder and offers
effective analysis of the stakeholder's position and arguments.

Today I have elected to turn in my english rhetorical
analysis assignment by the end of the day, though I have not actually
started writing the 1800 words and now the word wrap might keep going
I am not sure whether I want to do this or not okay this is friggin
sick! Now the word wrap goes all the way to the end of the document
and I can just keep writing what I want to write I enjoy this
immensely just kidding my thoughts are going. Must work on something
now, but what? "By the end of the day" would definitely suggest that I
would be turning the paper in before midnight... but I don't imagine
that my professor is still awake at this time and I may as well have
uuntil the morning so I may stay up all night and get this done. The
sacred space essay I also have until 11 or so tomorrow technically to
still be able to receive an 80 on it. I had many thoughts in reading
my classmate's paper. I said one thing earlier that I think may have
been interpreted as an insult or narcissistic comment, about not
needing to use the writing center that TCU provides, though I hope
this was not this case. Anyways, I can begin brainstorming about the
sacred space project. Just kidding, it would be more worth my time to
focus on the rhetorical analysis paper that will analyze Dave Rubin's
argument style in his internet address of the Intellectual Dark
Web. The group of people and style of conversation definitely seems to
be tthe kind of deep thinking, though the word "Intellectual" does
also seem to bug me.

Who gets to say, really, who is an intellectual?  Is this just a
scholar? A smart person? Intelligence, I presume. I still am of the
thought that no one really known what constitutes intelligence, seeing
as we are still coming up with better ways to construct artificial
intelligence. "If I cannot make it, then I do not understand it," is a
saying that comes to mind which may apply to the current situation
with regards to humans' understanding of intelligence. I want to say
that Feynman was the one who said this, though I am also fairly
certain that the quote is not exactly the way he said it.

I have gotten side-tracked, perhaps? The rhetorical analysis, yes. Off
the top of my head, I remember Rubin coming across as quite passionate
about his viewpoint. This is alright insofar as he acknowledges that
it is not /the/ viewpoint, which from his other podcasts and shows, it
seems he has done a good job. Best shown in this address, however, is
perhaps where he mentions how his political stance has changed in a
number of ways. From the left more toward the right, in his case,
generally speaking, but also toward strong defense of the principle of
free speech. Here is where I anticipate the highest amount of public
controversy. The question, "At what point does someone's right to
freedom of speech trump another person's right not to be offended?"
the answer to which would certainly correlate with one's perception of
the whole Intellectual Dark Web movement.

I think that I need to put more of my thoughts down onto my laptop, as
I am doing now. I think also that I have been a slow writer
recently. Not so sure that this is necessarily a bad thing, though I
also think that there is some truth to the idea that one does not
usually sit down with a blank document and start writing any piece in
the way that it will be when it is finished. Outlining seems to be of
great help, generalizing a topic into main categories and then into
themes or the most important ideas involved. Then, expanding each
point in a sort of tree, like fashion until the writing is at an
appropriate level of detail. This is to be contrasted with just
beginning at the final level of detail, not having any indication as
to how long the writing may end up being if the writer is to keep said
level of detail throughout all of the paper. Thus, it seems more
vulnerable to inconsistencies and possibly getting side-tracked into
irrelevant conversation. Losing sight of the big picture would be a
good way to say what I mean.

So alright, lets see what kinds of topics I will be covering. The
"mind map" technique as discussed in class for the op-ed might also be
a great way to structure this analysis writing. The main focus here
being the specific argument of one stakeholder, Dave Rubin. Perhaps it
is more of an attitude of "here is this issue that I am curious about
and this person seems to have something to say about it - what is he
saying and why might I be inclined to believe him?" This question is
hard to phrase, considering that our professor has stated on multiple
occasions that the analysis claim be about the /nature/ of the stake
holder's argument on the issue, *not* about the issue itself. In the
simplest terms I can imagine, "why should I listen to [stakeholder]?"
is the question that it seems we are trying to answer. Though this is
perhaps too broad in the sense that the focus should be just on the
argument that is being made (from the specific source
mentioned). Nonetheless, I like this approach as it is very relevant
in research and forming an opinion on the issue, hearing what others
are saying and how they are saying it.

Free Speech is the largest topic Intellectual Dark Web is the subtopic
The Rubin Report is the stakeholder YouTube is the media platform /
communication medium

At what point does one's right to freedom of speech trump one's right
not to be offended?

Free Speech vs. Hate speech debate?  Wikipedia, "fighting words" What
is protected under the U.S. law?

While the question is a rather controversial one, this is the main
topic of my project.

A situation is which one feels that by being honest and expressing
one's opinion, in good faith, one may risk offending the person that
is spoken to.

I imagine the situation in which I have been born and raised in Nazi
Germany in a family and community which supports the Nazi
regime. Suppose I meet an outsider at a coffee shop and begin talking
to them about life. Suppose also that this person is Jewish, and that
I think Jewish people are evil and deserving of death based solely on
the fact that they identify as a Jew. One major thing to note here is
that, what if we also suppose that I am of the mind that /cares/ whether
or not it is true that Jews are deserving of death. That is to say
that, I am a unique kind of Nazi who believes in what he has been told
insofar as this is all he has known, and that this is his best guess
as to how to act in the world. Now, (and I suppose I am changing
perspectives) if the Nazi were to tell the Jew that he thinks Jews
should die, this would surely cause a great deal of distress and
offensiveness. My question is, how would said Nazi be able to change
his mind out of some radical position if no one allows him to state
his position aloud? What if no one is there to hear his reasoning and
try to correct his errors of judgment? It seems that he would instead
be likely to face immediate retaliation with no explanation as to why
his opponents are responding in this way. Such seems tragic as
everyone involved may be doing only what he/she believes is correct,
though there should surely be no tolerance for an opinion that wishes
the death of another human. Such is to use freedom of expression to
advocate the suppression of expression of another individual. Life
seems as good an unalienable right as any, but what about freedom of
expression? What is a good policy to take when someone is using their
freedom of speech to interfere with someone else's freedom of speech?
"I think that you shouldn't be able to say that" is a basic way of
putting this, and it sounds an awful lot like the words of someone who
may have just been offended. It seems identical to saying "I think
people's speech should not be free under the law."

An interesting thing to point out is also that any speech is
ultimately subject to certain consequences, not just legal. If someone
wants to fire someone for posting that their boss is a bitch to
Facebook, certainly this is acceptable. For Sam Harris, who states
frequently that it is important to be able to criticize bad ideas,
what consequences should come of the opinion that Islam is the mother
load of bad ideas? This is not to say that Muslims should be killed,
of course, nothing at all about Muslims as human beings. The idea,
however, that Muhammad is the final messiah and son of God and that
the Koran contains the infallible word of god, (which indicates that
certain members of a society are deserving of death), is argued to be
one that should not be respected, perhaps? What do we mean by, I do
not like this idea. Should we get rid of the idea? Death to an idea?
Or advocation against the idea of Islam, perhaps? Being able to argue
against it publicly so as to offer reasons not to become a Muslim and
let those who read decide whether or not this is convincing? I think
yes, this is what is meant by holding an opposition to an idea. It is
only to say that "I think there are good reasons for /not/ believing in
Islam," for example in this situation. It is a rather harmless
statement of opinion, it seems. "I think it is a bad idea" turns into
"I think I can convince you not to become a Muslim"

I wonder if the controversy surrounding a phobia of Islam arises from
the ambiguity of being a Muslim. The Koran might explicitly instruct
believers to kill those who have turned their back on Allah, in which
case we must know what is to be interpreted by someone identifying as
Muslim? Is this equivalent to saying that one wishes death upon
nonbelievers? Perhaps a clarification need to be made on a massive
scale for the community of Muslims, thereby forcing those who wish
death to be recognized and potentially face conflicts under the law
should they not reevaluate their beliefs. Meanwhile, it should be
encouraged that the Muslim community do this, if any of what I have
said here has any correspondence with reality.

I have, of course, gone way off topic here, I'm afraid. While my
thoughts on the idea of free speech are more clear, I must still
evaluate the argument style in Rubin's video. Let the all-nighter
begin.

What Makes a Good Infographic? (piktochart)

I feel like college doesn't teach students /how to disagree/. By /how to
disagree/ I mean how to deal with disgreement, or how to resolve
disagreements in a civil manner. In a writing argument, I felt as
though everyone in the class was learning how to be persuasive about
whatever it is they think is true, that is, how to make it sound like
you're right. Managing /real/ disagreement strikes me as precisely the
activity that teaches people how to recognize when they are /wrong/. If
we are not practicing to recognize when we are wrong, but are instead
only taught how to appear persuasive (often arguing against people who
aren't in the classroom), it would follow that one never learns the
appropriate way to react when in a disagreement, possibly sensitive?

I have had this thought before, but it has just now come back to me: I
think it best in any situation not to state a disagreement if you are
not prepared to explain yourself.

Have been spending valuable time on the internet reading articles and
things on civil discourse, intellectual humility and scientific
humility. I want to be able to describe the feelings that I have for
the idea of 'humility,' but I am not so sure this is exactly the right
way to describe the attitutes to which I am inclined. This began in my
research of the Intellectual Dark Web and controversial speakers,
first focusing on free speech and then narrowed into civil discourse.

Finishing up my rhetorical analysis, I think the main points that I am
trying to make are that Dr. Helms is influenced by postmodern
thought. How much he ascribes to the messages is probably what I
should focus on primarily, as opposed to the actual validity of the
theory itself. Leaving the opinion for the op-ed.

What has he done though, with respect to postmodern thought. The idea
that clarity is a myth? Why, then, has he resorted to stating that
sometimes we must take things on faith and not remain skeptical? 

Today I am going to wing this motherfucking project like a
motherfucking boss. Just kidding we will have to see how it turns out
but I feel like I am on to something. Don't know quite what it is but
it sure seems that postmodernism is a load of bullshit. Okay so how
should I start off the argument? Will need to make a statement of
rhetorical analysis of Dr. Helms. I have some data from a previous
class, could go off of the template from the book about Obama:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Many people admire the vision and eloquence of President Obama; others
are put off by his often distant tone and his “professorial” stance. A
close look at several of his speeches will illuminate both sides of
this debate.
#+END_QUOTE

I may look at Dr. Helms and say that some people admire the "vision
and eloquence," or something like this. I could probably do something
like, instead of eloquence and vision I could do: well Dr. Helms is
very polite in class, perhaps this would be one. He is very outspoken,
passionate and motivated. Obviously he loves his job, I think that is
clear. Devotion is a good term. On the other hand, I think he is
fundamentally mistaken about some really core ideologies that he holds
(if he indeed holds the ones that I think he does). 

The public issue that I will be doing is postmodernism and its
influence on the universities. The stakeholder will be Dr. Helms, as
stated, and my rhetorical analysis claim could be that some people
admire Dr. Helms' engaging and passionate teaching style, some are put
off by the postmodern philosophy that has infected the university
Humanities departments. Nah, perhaps that second part would instead
focus on just how Dr. Helms seems to cause distress in students who
really take the course seriously. No, I must not say this either in
the event that this comes across as belittling toward my classmates. I
am thinking that what I mean to say is probably something along the
lines of how Dr. Helms teaching style does not lend itself to much
skepticism. That is, the classroom environment does not set an
atmosphere of civility and respect for the individual.

Should I relate this back to the overall problem of Postmodernism that
I am trying to address? It would have to be something like how the
postmodern philosophies are affecting the classroom, or no, it must
not involve my opinion so it would be more on the views of Dr. Helms
and whether or not he displays any symptoms (lol) of postmodern
thinking. 

I really don't mean this in any sort of negative way, it just so
happens that this philosophy has seemingly been the very root from
which I have had my troubles with the English department at TCU.

Talking with Dr. Helms today
- I care and think alot about argumentative writing
- does my epistemology conflict with the nature of this course
- truth vs Truth and selective vs. genuine skepticism
- /persuasion/ is not my goal as a person, seeking Truth is
- "It seems to me like this would be a good idea, what do you think?"
- choosing you as stakeholder, value of two-sided disagreements, mediation
- focus on the writer, not the reader (writing for understanding, not action)
- Learning by resolving conflict - am I learning how to create them?
- figuring out how to interpret project goals

Requires a diversity statement.

Why is diversity important to you.

To promote a more diverse population.

It seems assumed that lack of diversity is a bad thing, with no
exception or explanation.

- minority
- black
- white

giving groups the freedom to grow

How white the national conference is

"my field is 98% white... this is nuts!"

# major project stuff

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The goal of this assignment is to provide you with a challenging
opportunity to (a) analyze the depth and breadth of a public problem
or issue, (b) identify a plausible solution, and (c) persuade others
to agree with and take action to enact the solution, drawing on
significant primary and secondary sources. You will learn to use
advanced strategies for developing ideas and analyzing arguments, with
evidence of critical thinking in both the conception and the
development of the thesis. You will write in ways that define and
develop an argument with a clear rationale and compelling supporting
material, and you will participate in teamwork in ways that
demonstrate interdependence and accountability.
#+END_QUOTE

1. analyze the depth and breadth of a public problem or issue
2. develop your perspective on the issue 
3. explain why you  

Make an argument for intellectual humility.
Present a way to publicly support viewpoint diversity.

What do I actually want to argue for? Argue? Reason? What do I think?

Hey Cole, what do you think about postmodernism?  In what sense?  This
is what comes to my mind: Does this sound like postmodernism to you?
crafting a rogerian argument for the sake of the person involved,
trying to reach a common understanding. The postmodernist views are
not exactly the most influential in the Humanities at TCU. What is
misunderstood about them? What do I need to know about people who are in the humanities and practice postmodernism?

We are trying to figure it out. I don't know what I am doing but gosh
darn it I'm trying okay now let me get back to work.

Hoepfully we can talk about the things that I will want to cover.

- "makes sense"
- scientific theories are the most convincing arguments
- having to say X vs. having X to say (latter is more persuasive)
- "persuade others to agree"
- logical fallacies and non-explanations
- what if people don't care for full explanations?
    - protest and maintain humility (is this possible?)
    - or, explain to any who listen (convince or _make corrections_ accordingly)
    - speaker cannot _decide_ to be persuasive
    - good arguments draw from what listeners already believe (start from valid premises)
    - honest arguments draw from what the speaker previously believed

**** wb2.jpg
- a good argument is a well-developed argument (has more answers to "why?" Qs)
    - but persuasive arguments are not always good ones
- must we always pick between good and persuasive? (perhaps, if the listener disagrees/is lazy)
- sometimes good arguments undermine listeners' other beliefs
    - sometimes _honest_ arguments do this
- listeners must be willing to challenge themselves (Intellectual Humility)
- reaching _new_ conclusions often is fine, challenging old ones often isn't
    - judge an argument by its conclusion or a _conclusion by its argument_? (listener's choice)
    - HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THE FORMER?!

**** wb3.jpg
- the audience determines persuasiveness
- science cares about good arguments/explanations, not "persuasive" ones 
- some audiences can be persuaded by _bad_ (fallacious) arguments
    - and some don't know how to follow/identify _good_ (consistent) ones
- am I persuading others of an _argument_ or of a _conclusion_?
- if others judge my argument by its conclusion (and disagree), do I modify the conclusion?
    - No, try to justify judging instead by the argument 
- it's not about what you think, but _HOW_ you think
- my goal is for what I say to "make sense" (it's followable, reasonable, specific, etc.)
    - if it does, you might: 
        1. think that it is correct and then believe in or adopt the argument  
        2. disagree and understand where and why it is incorrect -> (EXPLAIN! PLEASE!)
    - if it doesn't make sense, then I have failed. (would rather have said nothing)

**** Rogerian/Invitational Argument
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The key to Rogerian argumentation is a willingness to think about opposing positions and to describe
them fairly. In a Rogerian structure, you have to acknowledge that alternatives to your claims exist
and that they might be reasonable under certain circumstances. In tone, Rogerian arguments steer
clear of heated and stereotypical language, emphasizing instead how all parties in a dispute might
gain from working together.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
such listening — in effect, walking in the other person’s shoes — helps you see that person’s points
of view more clearly and thoroughly and thus offers a basis for moving together toward new
understandings.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Invitational rhetoric has as its goal not winning over opponents but getting people and groups to
work together and identify with each other; it strives for connection, collaboration, and the
mutually informed creation of knowledge.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Remember that in such arguments, your goal is enhanced understanding so that you can open up a space
for new perceptions and fresh ideas.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The lesson to take from Rogerian or invitational argument is that it makes good sense in structuring
your own arguments to learn opposing positions well enough to state them accurately and honestly, to
strive to understand the points of view of your opponents, to acknowledge those views fairly in your
own work, and to look for solutions that benefit as many people as possible.
#+END_QUOTE

**** Toulmin Argument

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The richest, most interesting part of a writer’s work — backing — remains to be done after the
argument has been outlined. Clearly stated claims and warrants show you how much evidence you will
need.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Experienced writers know that qualifying expressions make writing more precise and honest.
#+END_QUOTE

On Page 143...
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
For example, you may be a big fan of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and the National
Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and prefer that federal tax dollars be spent on these programs. So you
offer the following claim:

*Claim*: The federal government should support the arts.

You need reasons to support this thesis, so you decide to present the issue as a matter of values:

*Argument*:  The federal government should support the arts because in Brief it also supports the
military.

Now you’ve got an enthymeme and can test the warrant, or the premises of your claim:

*Warrant*: if the federal government can support the military, then it can also support other
programs.

But the warrant seems frail: you can hear a voice over your shoulder saying, “In essence, you’re
saying that Because we pay for a military, we should pay for everything!” So you decide to revise
your claim:

*Revised Argument*: if the federal government can spend huge amounts of money on the military, then it
can afford to spend moderate amounts on arts programs.

Now you’ve got a new warrant, too:

*Revised Warrant*: A country that can fund expensive programs can also afford less expensive programs.

This is a premise that you can defend, since you believe strongly that the arts are just as
essential as a strong military is to the well-being of the country. Although the warrant now seems
solid, you still have to offer strong grounds to support your specific and controversial claim. So
you cite statistics from reputable sources, this time comparing the federal budgets for the military
and the arts. You break them down in ways that readers can visualize, demonstrating that much less
than a penny of every tax dollar goes to support the arts.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Dealing with conditions of rebuttal is an essential part of argument. But it’s important to
understand rebuttal as more than mere opposition. Anticipating objections broadens your horizons,
makes you more open to alternative viewpoints, and helps you understand what you need to do to
support your claim.
