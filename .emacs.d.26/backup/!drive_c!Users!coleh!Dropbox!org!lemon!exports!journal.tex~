\section{Poem Freewrite}
\label{sec:orge0891a9}
\begin{quote}
Use an animal/plant/behavior as description of how to interact with something that you care about
\end{quote}

Abstract \cite{kane1985dynamics} analogy to the tree, as the primary structure for gaining conceptual understanding of things. A story of the squirrel, 
in a treetop navigating the beautiful colors of the tree. The idea that mysterious things often have reasons, if one is willing to 
navigate away from the leaves and search for the trunk. \\
\par
Relevant qualities of a squirrel.\\
\par
Squirrel hops around on the tips of branches. An acrobat, dancer, tight-rope walker.
Perhaps instead, the spider monkey.\\
\par
"Spider Monkey Intelligence"\\
\par
Can expand on this idea. A tree structure of learning and the student as a spider monkey.

\section{Ode Freewrite}
\label{sec:orge7d1a86}

What to put in my Ode, a poem of praise. What do I like? What is
valuable to me? Calculus is valuable to me - I think the concept has
been immensely powerful in science, generally. Perhaps I should write
an Ode to Calculus? Who will my audience be and why would they care?
Perhaps the personal story of Isaac Newton who is said to have
invented calculus, (though Gottfried Leibniz also independently
discovered this at around the same time) or maybe even to introduce
the topic poetically? Tiny changes in quantifiable things and how they
compare to tiny changes in other things. Ode to the internet? Praise the internet,
that is something that is immensely valuable nowadays. Praise modern technology?
That's the best I can come up with, honestly?

\section{Ode Freewrite}
\label{sec:orgc92a8ea}
\begin{quote}
Write an ode to some thing that triggers the senses, (a guilty pleasure?)
\end{quote}

It really seems to me that guilty pleasures are things that people
should not have.  I am confused as to why we have just spent some time
going around the room asking others what their guilty pleasures are,
in a lighthearted and fun manner, not that it should be darkly
serious, thought they are certainly not things to be complacent of. I
wish to write an ode to something that is intensely and surprisingly
interesting and motivating, particularly where there would not seem to 
be any initial importance. Mathematics comes to mind, or the conceptual 
explanations in physics. I am not sure if this is the intended topic or 
if we are being asked to write more of a pleasurable thing, one that captures 
the emotions in an uncontrolled way; illogically, it would seem. \\
\par
I almost want to pick any common piece of technology, for which I
might have just a little bit of historical and technical knowledge,
and write an ode to that which appreciates every human which has
contributed to there being this piece of technology. \\
\par
Ode to Electricity \\
Ode to an Electron \\
Ode to a Computer \\
Ode to Richard Feynman \\
\par
Ode to an Expo Marker \\
\par
The expo marker, \\
asleep on metal \\
awaits a curious hand. \\
\par
A twist and pull of its cap, \\
crisp, gentle fumes \\
tickle the imagination. \\
\par
Invited is anyone who dares, \\
Feynman or Fieri \\

\section{Losing Someone}
\label{sec:org77e76e0}
\par
Lisa, Dad, Mom, Grandpa, Miller, Hank \\
I think we disagreed \\
I think you were wrong, yet \\
I think you are human \\
I think you are trying \\
When someone is wrong, yet trying not to be. \\
I am wrong in some way, though I am trying not be as wrong. \\
\par
To maintain relationships with people you disagree with
you must find an even deeper sense of respect to hold up against 
controversy. The deeper the relationship, the deeper the wound left when ripped apart. \\
\par
Hank and I had a deeper relationship.

\section{Losing Something}
\label{sec:org21c658f}
\par
Universtity, Youth, Library The University that Robbed me of my
Knowledge It is not what you do not know that get's you into trouble,
It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.  I have learned to say
that I know nothing. Though before, I may very well have thought that
I did. For this reason, the university has robbed me of my
knowledge. Yet all the more, it has shown me what a joke knowledge
is. No one knows. That is the grand punchline of adulthood. Some get
it, others don't. Once one has experienced the freedom in admitting
this, one may continue.  What will one do once one realizes that
he/she is wrong? Will she try to be less wrong? Will he think that he
must be right? 

\section{Humorous Loss}
\label{sec:org7ada9b3}
\par
I have lost my video game obsession. What a wonderful waste of time
this was.  An addiction, a hunger, a fancy for what seems now to be a
complete hedonic disgrace. It took a certain level of unseriousness to
be this way. To refuse to contemplate the reality of my life. To fall
captive to the growing experience machine on modern technology. How
could I make this funny? Sarcastic? Perhaps not so lighthearted, as I
feel I do not have a particularly light heart. This is not to mean
that I do not find enjoyment in things, only it is to mean that I take
my experiences as thoughtfully as I can, and to ascribe due weights to
all those things which are truly important. Video games fall terribly
short of any kind of such standard.

\section{Political Poetry}
\label{sec:org5fd725b}
\par
Politically Charged Poetry?
Find a folkloric interpretation of the word "Sunshower" on wikipedia
and write a poem that uses the meaning of this word.
Is there such thing as a bad poem? 
One can convey emotions very well but demonstrate no thought\ldots{}
I don't think that this is the best thing to be doing with an education 
indoctrination, is that happening 

\section{Series of Unfortunate Events}
\label{sec:orge0ba29a}
\begin{quote}
Write about a character who undergoes a series of unfortunate events.
\end{quote}

Someone who is similar in character to Lisa Waking up in the morning
and from then a series of small things occur that slowly ramp up
anxiety and frustration.  Until there is one thing which sets it just
past the threshold. Small event such as, walking to the front door to
find a large package which has been delivered. Upon bringing the
package into the home, dragging it as it is quite large and tall, the
box becomes unstable and falls to the ground with a loud unsettling
slap. Then the girl who was transporting the box is overcome by sudden
and starling emotion and immediately starts crying and also lies down
on the floor next to the box. Events toward the beginning of the story
could include small everyday things involving other people. Perhaps in
the noble attempt to be an optimist and a people-pleaser, "bottling
up" any negative emotion without proper critical thought to the point
where it overflows. \\
\par
In the wake of this are solemn cries for help, maybe to a diety, where
sudden recognition of one's own incapabilities causes great emotional
suffering, even after such an innocuous event. After this event, I
presume it would be common for people to return to a state of false
pride in themselves, to a state which is ready to bottle up more
negative feelings as they come. Only periodically, when this metaphorical 
bottle overflows, are they ever really dealt with. Why, then, shouldn't 
she instead get rid of the bottling regime, and instead try to deal with 
incoming feelings as soon as possible? Deal with, as in taking the time 
to critically think about what one is feeling, what has caused them to 
feel this way, and what problems need to be solved. Of course, if one has 
amassed such a large quantity of uncatered problems, by the time that 
this all boils over, I imagine it could easily overwhelm the person to 
try and asses all of these problemati situations for the first time.

\section{Parental Disapproval}
\label{sec:org70a11a7}
\begin{quote}
Write about a 20-something y/o confronting parents about their
dissaproval of a decision in the lobby of a retirement home where one
of their grandparents lives.
\end{quote}

Should I write about myself? I am in a situation where my grandfather
has been in the hospital recovering from brain surgery. He had a
subdural hematoma, and I have not called or texted him to wish him
good health. I have certainly been thinking of him, as I have thought
to bring this up here, yet I do not feel a terrible urge to let him
know. So I was thinking about this prompt and how it relates to my current 
situation, as if I was to go visit my grandfather in a retirement home and 
confront my parents about this decision that I am making not to speak with 
him. \\
\par
Perhaps I write about some fictive characters and the common qualities
of being in the nursing home. The old people smell, the sounds of high
pitched beepers going off in the hallways. The staff dressed in
scrubs, and the open doors exposing the cells of quite vegetable-like
humans.  As for what decision the character could be wrestling with
their parents about, I initially imagine something like finding a
place to live, paying rent for living at home, or some other perhaps
more petty things. I could imagine and describe the specific color of
clothing, just having come from church on a sunday, or the mood of the
family and emotional stress of visiting an elder in such a retirement
home. Perhaps the issue could be with the 20-something year old not 
wanting to be there to visit the older person. Her grandfather, say, 
might not even remember who she his or be able to hold a conversation. 
Though the parents feel that it is important to spend time with family, 
even when the reason for this is not clear.

\section{Let Nature be your Teacher}
\label{sec:org75ae00a}
\begin{quote}
Let nature be your teacher: Reflect upon the ways in which the natural word intesects with your life
\end{quote}

This prompt seems to place the definition of the natural world as the
\emph{outside} world. As in, the desks and chairs in this classroom are
somehow separate from this "natural" world. In the sense that I gather
from physics, \textbf{all} of my experience intersects with the natural world.
The natural world is all that it seems that I have. I will concede
that man-made things are what is to be separated from this term,
\emph{artificial} vs.  \emph{natural}, perhaps. In this sense, it seems that the
artificial has been constructed from the natural, such that the
properties of the natural world reveal themselves in all of the
artificial things. Again, it seems I cannot escape the pervasiveness of 
nature.\\
\par
Considering my current academic interests, I have become focused
intensely on studying exactly the natural world and its
properties. The ideas and theories about nature that I have
encountered in my studies have completely revamped my experience of
nature, especially in the everyday perceptions of roads, trees,
automobiles, buildings, etc. I instead am inclined to reflect not just
on how the natural world intersects with my life, per se, but how my
life is driven by my fascination with this natural world. What is
called "natural philosophy" is what interests me, and this clearly
would reflect the idea that to me, the natural world is everything.\\
\par
A flood of questions comes over me sometimes when looking around at
nature - sometimes at very ordinary things. The way light bounces off
the shiny surfaces of cars on the highway as I drove from Austin back
to Fort Worth today, for example. To try and better answer the
question of how nature "intersects" with my life, I guess that nature
intersects with my life as it is the most central source of my
motivations.  It is so interesting/fascinating/humbling/peculiar, and
continually reminds me:
\begin{quote}
But see that the imagination of nature is
far, far greater than the imagination of man.
\end{quote}
-- Richard Feynman

\section{Against Expectations}
\label{sec:org6c515a8}
\begin{quote}
Write about a time you did something you weren't \emph{supposed} to do, but you did it for good reasons
\end{quote}

I could write about the time I decided not to go to my seminar course
and instead go to a poster presentation session in the physics
department. I confronted the professor about it on that day, once he
realized that I was not in class, and I calmly asked what the
consequences were for not going.\\
\par
The things that were going through my head on that day were nearly all
about the poster that I had put together for Student Research
Symposium at TCU. I was working on the same project that I am still
focused on today -- trying to mathematically model the progression of
respiratory tract infection for different kinds of patients and
viruses -- and this was the second poster that I was going to present
to the public. My research habits were also less developed then. I
remember I would spend a majority of my time scribbling equations and
working alone without an appropriate amount of time spent trying to
write up my findings in a format that others can read. So, during the
weekend before this presentation session I was gaining practice in
pausing my research and communicating my progress -- practice that I
desperately needed.\\
\par
The day came, where our posters would be hung in the science building
and the physics department faculty were invited to come judge and
interrogate us about our projects in preparation for the symposium on
the coming Friday.  Unfortunately, my poster session was scheduled at
the same time as one of my physics courses. It was just a one-hour
credit seminar course for freshman physics majors and I was taking it
as a third-year student because it was required. Coincidentally, the
room that this class was held was directly adjacent to the room where
my poster would be hung. Naturally, instead of going to the seminar
course, I went into the poster session to hear what other professors
and students may have been able to say about my poster, on which I had worked 
quite diligently. 

\section{Something I am Afraid of}
\label{sec:org43f6edb}
\begin{quote}
Write about something that you are afraid of. Starting with the
experience of this fear and moving toward understanding. (after
\emph{Snakebit} by Alia Volz)
\end{quote}

I am afraid of death, I suppose. I have of course never experienced
it, though I often shudder in the thought of getting hit by a car as I
cross the street. Perhaps this will work - this is a fairly common
thing for me to be thinking about anyways. Initially focus on death as
through the intense psychological responses to being in dangerous
situations or even just from imagining dangerous things. Then, moving
toward an inquiry on the concept of death, and confronting one's own
mortality. To keep it after \emph{Snakebit} I suppose it should be in the
first person. The final message could be along the same lines as
Volz's but with deeper consideration. I recall when I was younger, I
guess in middle school or so, I would by lying awake on my bed at
night, still, thinking about trying to go to sleep when my thoughts
would evolve into questions about consciousness:\\
\par
What is about to happen to me, when I fall asleep? Will I have a
dream? Will I remember it if I do? What does my brain do while I
sleep? If I am unconscious, how far is this from being dead? Am I my
brain? What happens when someone gets shot in the head? If the brain
dies, does this mean I die? Where do I go then? Back to where I came
from? How did I even come to have this brain in the first place? I
guess I don't know what is going to happen to me after I die.\\
\par
One option is to just not think about it, which I have safely done for 
most of the 20 years of my experience.
\section{Explain Yourself}
\label{sec:org3491897}
\par
I have run into what seems to be the root of my tree of virtues:
being able to explain myself to others. The argument for this as
a virtue is quite huge, and stems primarily from acknowledging
that I am at all times fallible, and that other people are
capable of having experiences just like I do.\\
\par
What percentage of your decisions would you say are well-justified?
How important is it for someone to be \textbf{trying} to find reasons for
his/her actions?  If I can't explain to you why I do or believe
something, \textbf{in a way that you understand}, is it anyone's fault other
than my own that you do not understand?

\section{Seriousness}
\label{sec:org5e57f43}
\par
In the way that I think of "seriousness," it sure seems that one
cannot ever have enough. When told that I may be over-thinking
something, I have the tendency to ask why it seems I am doing so, and
often times the responses I get are unclear. Of course, I acknowledge
the "analysis paralysis" phenomenon and always want to be doing that
for which there is the best reason (that I know of) to do, though
throughout my experience in SE-style conversation (primarily with
friends that I meet regularly), the "you're over-thinking it" and
"it's not that serious" cards always seem to be the fastest ways to
end an interesting conversation.\\
\par
I should warn you that in just the last year I have gone from a lousy
college kid who was just scraping by with a minimal number of courses
(albeit hard ones) to a dude who's so busy and orderly that his
roommates wonder what has gotten into him. I, too, wonder if I
have been neglecting some larger picture items, but my newfound seriousness
has not come without the most motivation, meaning, and joy I can recall.
\section{Productivity}
\label{sec:orgd6a9b50}
\par
I have been very interested lately in finding tricks to improve my
productivity.  Emacs has certainly been a great help, I hope to find
more packages and features to install that can help. Main things that
I went over last night included todo lists, where to keep them, how to
prioritize, when to prioritize vs. when to work on things, and also
what can help with motivation. Takeaways inluded the idea that I
generally am generally productive in two different ways, planning and
in doing. \emph{Thinking} and \emph{acting} if you will.  I drew a diagram on my
white board that showed some sort of repeatable procedure as: 

$$ REFLECT \rightarrow PRIORITIZE \rightarrow EXECUTE $$ 

Of course the nuance flooded in at the moment that I reflected on what
I had drawn, as perhaps prioritizing does not always lead to
execution. Much more thinking is to be done about this very
theoretical picture I have - it's not exactly clear if this will be of
much help to me currently.
\section{Ambient Rhetoric}
\label{sec:org6a5fa57}
\par
I have been reading \emph{Ambient Rhetoric} by Thomas
Rickert, and I have been meaning to sit down and put together all my
thoughts on what I have read so far. Before revisiting the book, I
recall feelings of disapproval for the way in which Rickert carries
out the support for his theory of ambience. For a skeptical reader, he
does not seem to offer very many counterarguments to his
claims. Nonetheless, he discusses some \emph{very} interesting topics including
complexity science, which I have much personal interest in and some
experience with. This is also not to mention cognitive science which
is also extremely fascinating. I am struck by one thing in particular
that he says about this though, something along the lines of
"Cognitive science is a large and vibrant field, and for this reason I
will only consider aspects of the field which support the theorizing
of ambience" which to me, sounds awfully non-scientific, or at least
non-popperian. I feel that without a fair evaluation of the points at
which his theories may be refuted, the reader has little opportunity
to judge the reliability of the author. This is precicely what has
made the text so hard to sit down and read, for my trust that Rickert
is communicating true insight dwindles after every claim that is made
without acknowledging possible flaws.\\
\par
For an afficionado of various theories and literature on rhetoric,
\emph{Ambient Rhetoric} takes great strides in his interdisciplinary approach
to the subject, yet for the skeptical reader it offers no redress. For
instance, Rickert introduces many fascinating points of discussion in
areas from cognitive science to complexity and network theories, all
of which seem to rightly suggest a need for substantial change in
modern conceptions of rhetoric. It is speaking about cognitive
science, however, that he states rather obtusely, "I only draw on work
that contributes to theorizing ambience" (Rickert, 101). With each
however interesting claim that is made, a lack of consideration for
alternative interpretation or contrary evidence puts the unfamiliar
reader in a position of progressively diminishing confidence. A reader
who finds his or herself the slightest bit skeptical is sure to
contemplate putting the book down.
\section{Walkway Blues by M83}
\label{sec:org921bbea}
\par
I have no idea what to work on right now. I am listening to Walkway
Blues by M83, eating chicken fried rice that was \$.80 at the grocery
store. My sterling engine is sitting in a white bowl of ice, slowly
chugging along on my window sill. Also, I did not pick the song, it
appeared on my discover playlist that spotify generates every week. I
declined an offer to go to the pool with my roommates where they were
grilling with lots of their friends, none of whom I have been able to
find any particular interest in. Any conversation that I feel would be
important to bring up seems obviously out of place, given the content
of normal discussions in the group. Would be quite funny were I to
disrupt the social equilibrum with questions about religion or
politics. 
\section{Haskell}
\label{sec:org9f6e02f}
\par
I just started learning Haskell lately, and I love it. The
whole idea of a purely functional programming language fascinates
me. Several times, while coding a project for my operating systems
class, I found myself compelled to express my enthusiasm verbally, in
the event that a certain algorithm was found out to be only a line or
two of code. Features that come to mind include 'filter' 'map' 'zip'
and the like, which I had never used before. Very cool! I want to have
a project to use this for so I don't end up writing in the language
for no purpose. I presume that I will be able to find a purpose
soon. After completing the operating systems project, which was an
implementation of the banker's algorithm, I proceeded to write a 2D
ray tracing program in Haskell which demonstrates the behavior of
ideal lenses.  This was very fun, and though I did not intend to show
this off to others, I did email a picture of the simulation to my
physics professor of Optics who promptly requested that I show this
simulation to my classmates. I wonder whether or not this should have
happened, it seems I would have been perfectly happy having kept the
program to myself.  In conversation with my operating systems
professor, I also mentioned that I had liked Haskell so much that I
wrote another little program for my physics class. He, of course,
asked my to show him the program and I did. Multiple times he said,
"has this been done before??" for which I did not have much of a
response. It really is not an amazingly complex program, I admit, it was 
done in the span of one afternoon/evening. \\
\par
On another note, I have also been meeting with my higher geometry math
professor, but not for that subject. My research with Dr. Dobrovolny
has led me into such topics as diffusion partial differential
equations, laplace transforms, complex analysis including contour integrals, 
residue theorems, and most recently, inner products of functions.
\section{Intelligence}
\label{sec:org33675fc}
No one knows what intelligence is. We only see the things that intelligence produces.
Seeing another person displaying intelligence is inspiring. We try to identify what it
was that produced that, and this is the whole point, that we don't know precisely what
produces intelligence. This may be the entire point of intelligence - admitting that one
does not know. For only then is a person allowed to grow, once he/she recognizes a lack
of expertise. If you admit that you do not know, then you can make the decision to try
and learn. Does modern education puts pressure on being able to say, ``Ooh, I know!'' ?
How tragic would it be if someone who did not know and admitted not knowing, received a
punishing grade in school? No one likes to say that they don't know. Not only is it
okay to say I don't know, but the more that one says I don't know, the more opportunities
she has to learn. It is heart-stopping how wrong we can be as humans. We are fallibile. How
does one reconcile with this? Should we be asking ourselves the question: Could I be wrong?
Or should we say more often, maybe, that's what it seems like to me now.\\
\par
What would a child think, if he showed up to school bringing his best pens and pencils,
excited to see the strange new world of school, where people get to become grown-ups, only
to be told that he needs to know what is going on! Know what test is going to be over on
friday. If you don't, you will have to sit out of recess. Not every child is perfect,
and certainly children cannot always follow reasonable arguments for doing things, though
we should be careful not to imply that anyone should be afraid to say that they don't know.
To ask questions, to wonder about things. To have the nerve to recognize the gaps in one's own
knowledge base, and not to learn to cover up those gaps with excuses or disingenuous explanations.\\
\par
To say that one doesn't know and not be afraid is a challenge. Most seem to say that they don't know
everything but hold on to a few things which surely, they must really know, otherwise their whole life
would be for nothing! Would it be for nothing? How do you know that you know these things? What happens
when you try to question them, do you feel badly? Why do you feel badly? Should you believe in anything
that makes you feel badly for questioning it? Is wonder enough? Maybe it's not so bad, not knowing.
The intelligent are the most ill-represented. If people knew how intelligent people operated, they wouldn't
be called intelligent, would they?\\
\par
To me, the wise person has for a long time seemed to be the person who, when questioned about their actions,
would be able to give the best reasoning. He/she would be able to explain to the questioner why they have done something,
in a way that makes complete and total sense to the questioner, too. At that moment would the questioner realize that
they have stumbled into something great, into someone smart. They may even proceed to say ``Gosh, sir, you must be
really intelligent!'' to which the wise person might say, ``I don't know what that means.''
\section{For Lisa}
\label{sec:org809601b}

The following is what I wrote for Lisa on her birthday, giving her my
scribbled journal.  I was going to delete this text but I decided to
keep it for reflection on the thought process I was having that day. \\
\par
I don't know.

This took me a long time to make. 

I thought about a lot of things

I thought a lot about you in there

You're the closest person to me. You know what I think about all the time.

I hope this book can mean something to you. It meant a lot to me.

I over think things. and it sure seems like I can't help it.

I tried not to overthink giving you this.

I want us to be the best people.

I don't know what I'm doing, really, but I am trying to figure that out.

I have to go back home now.
