* "A Song About Naps" by Grynpyret
Welcome to the world
About a child awake in a strange world
Unfamiliar sounds, child like sounds
Everything is wonderful
Wide-eyed

It is a quiet morning. Nothing but the distant murmur of an old TV and
the steady drone of good 'ol Texas summer approved hospital air
conditioning. Two extra doctors are in today -- not for any sort of
work, though. 

"Good morning," they both whisper, first her, then
him. 

Surely the two of them did not just wake and greet eachother now, in
the nursery. There is someone else here.

"Do you want to show off? Hmm? Do you want to say hi?," she says
softly, at a bit higher pitch than usual. Fingers with red nails
slowly reach and pull, "There you are, look at you."

The other doc stands nearby; He doesn't have his coat on. His right
hand, wedged behind the strap of a Hitachi VHS camcorder, slowly moves
toward the little human. Hearing someone call him 'Dad' is going to take
some getting used to.

It was just another napping newborn, a boy, the same boy that would
wait until his twenties to find and watch that tape his father was
recording.
