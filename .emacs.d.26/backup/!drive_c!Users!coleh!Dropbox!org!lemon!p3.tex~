\section*{``A Song About Naps'' by Grynpyret}
\label{sec:org8233583}

It is a quiet morning. Nothing but the distant murmur of an old TV and
the steady drone of good ol' Texas summer approved hospital air
conditioning. Two extra doctors are in today -- not for any sort of
work, though. 

``Good morning,'' they both whisper, first her, then
him. 

Surely the two of them did not just wake and greet eachother now, in
the nursery. There is someone else here.

``Do you want to show off? Hm? Do you want to say hi?,'' she says
softly, at a bit higher pitch than usual. Fingers with red nails
slowly reach and pull, ``There you are, look at you.''

The other doc stands nearby; He doesn't have his coat on. His right
hand, wedged behind the strap of a Hitachi VHS camcorder, slowly moves
toward the little human. Hearing someone call him `Dad' is going to take
some getting used to.

It was just another napping newborn, a boy, the same boy that would
wait until his twenties to find and watch that tape his father was
recording. 

\section*{``Aminals'' by Baths}
\label{sec:orgf48acb4}

There's a new sheriff in town today. Hair as blond as it will ever be,
jean shorts, socks that come up just a touch too high, and a rocking
pair of silver Sketchers that yes, he can tie by himself. Sometimes he
goes by the name `goober' -- tongue out and hands on his face,
stretching the skin around two wide blue eyes, holding back the grin
and giggles just for a moment. Soon, Thomas and the other trains will
need him, the unfinished circuits of wood and plastic in the other
room beckon for the touch of an aspiring architect. He builds alone
but doesn't mind. After all, this town ain't big enough for two.

\section*{``7:00 AM'' by Tennyson}
\label{sec:orgbed7ccc}

It was a quiet morning. Nothing but a gentle beeping on the nightstand
and the usual soft rustling from the bed. No more bunk beds, the age
of sleepovers was over (he'd say he was too old for them). A familiar
smell of coffee slowly creeps it's way under the door -- grown-ups were
awake and it was time for school.

``Good morning'' the adults say, first her, then him.

Two fresh waffles sit on the counter for the siblings, each dressed
with syrup over a thick spread of peanut butter served with a hearty
glass of milk. The high schooler was first to come down as usual,
little sister known to be a heavy sleeper. The old Wrangler in the
garage would be his soon, but today the parental chauffeurs make a
trip to band rehearsal and then the clinic.

Asphalt still cool from the night, a perfect line of seven drums and
harnesses lie still in the parking lot. Sneakers screech and scratch across the pavement, drummers
rushing to pick them up and strap in.

A sharp voice cracks across the parking lot, ``Set!''

Earplugs in, eyes forward, sticks flat, chin up, look tough. 

``Eight on a hand, here we go!''

Drumline is life.

\section*{``Whoa!'' by Alizzz}
\label{sec:org95089c7}

There's a new student at the university today. Hair a bit darker than
it used to be, basketball shorts, flip-flops, and a flimsy drawstring
bag on his back that had only a few spiral notebooks, no laptop, and a
pencil that yes, he probably picked up off the ground. Sometimes he
goes by the name `guy in the back' -- leaning back, arms crossed,
circles of skin around his blue-gray eyes stretched by the last
night's Call of Duty rounds. Soon, he will need to figure out how to
get his shit together and start listening to his
professors. Insurmountably beautiful mathematics and ideas, spoken
about right there at the front of the class, grope for the ears of a
curious soul. To these he'll think: \emph{Woah}.

\section*{``Awake'' by Tycho}
\label{sec:org331f586}

A boy, looking out the back seat window, spies some distant clouds bathed
in sunlight from behind. The kind of scene where rays extend from
every plush fold in the sky. He remembers sixth grade biology and
learning about the water cycle, the names: stratus, cumulus,
cumulonimbus. A familiar state of mind, road-trip boredom turned to
questioning reality. 

Miles later, he hands his iPod silently forward to his mother in the
truck's passenger seat. Ambitious yet naive; the Notes app is open.

I want to be able to look around, wherever I am, and fully understand
everything before me, and when the complexities of space or the quarks
and leptons of atoms test my knowledge of things, I will strive to
understand as much as my brain and my time here will allow.\\

\section*{``Extreme Northern Lights'' by Majuere}
\label{sec:org5b6fbf8}

Fifth floor, the elevator dings. Bland carpet, the smell of paper, one
flickering light at the end of the floor -- exactly what you might
expect from the Perry-Casta√±eda Library downtown. A student walks to
the north side of the building, thumbs under the straps of a swollen
Columbia backpack, hoping to find an empty booth by the window. An
older foreign-looking light-skinned man reads at a smaller table near
the booths, where he has also been on almost every day at that same
time. Walking by, the student notices stacks of books on Hebrew and
bible translations, where it appears the man is handwriting something
illegible on plain copy paper. 

Books are unloaded from the backpack onto a table at the window. \\
\emph{Fundamentals of Statistical and Thermal Physics}, Reif \\
\emph{Complexity}, Waldrop \\
\emph{Stocism and Emotion}, Graver \\
\emph{The Philosophy of Karl Popper}, Keuth \\

A whiteboard stands on the other side of the floor, behind bookshelves
and out of sight. In the middle is a phrase written in the student's
handwriting from days before. He remembers this and comes to find it
still there.

\begin{quote}
``Is it possible that what I believe is untrue?''
\end{quote}

and underneath,

\begin{quote}
``Believe in yourself. \\
Think positive!

But anything's \\
possible if you just \\
believe``
\end{quote}

The moment becomes thick, swelling in his chest. Two wide blue eyes,
holding back the delight and tears just for a moment.

and complex as your own.

\section*{``Images Of Broken Light'' by Chihei Hatakeyama}
\label{sec:org11597a1}

It is a quiet morning. Nothing but faint chatter from down the hall
and familiar Texas air conditioning. A door is propped open, just a ways from the 
physics department office. A sheet on the door reads, ``physics tutoring hours,'' and 
a chart of times is listed. 

\begin{quote}
Friday -- 9:00 AM until 12:00 PM. 
\end{quote}

In the room is a round table with scattered chairs, enough to seat
ten; whiteboards on every wall. A phone buzzes on the table, with the
notification: ``Student Research Symposium.'' 

Two extra doctors are in Fort Worth today.

\begin{quote}
``Some people say, how can you live without knowing? I do not know what
they mean. I always live without knowing. That is easy. How you get to
know is what I want to know.''
