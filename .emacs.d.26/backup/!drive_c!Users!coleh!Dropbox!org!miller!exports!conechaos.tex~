\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:org5c2882d}

\section{The Billiard}
\label{sec:org41f925e}

We consider a spherical billiard with radius \(R\), initially in contact
with the inner surface of an overturned cone of angle \(\theta\), as
seen in [FIGURE]. Note that the position (\(\vec{r}\)) of the center of
this sphere will have a range identical to that of the infinitessimal
billiard, considering that the cone is only vertically separated from
the sphere's center by a distance \(R\sec\theta\). The velocity
(\(\vec{v}\)) of the center of mass of this billiard is just as before,
however we now introduce the angular velocity \(\vec{\omega}\) in
addition to the translational velocity in an effort to simulate a more
realistic system.

In spherical coordinates:

\begin{align*}
\vec{r} &= (r, \theta, \phi) \\
\vec{v} &= (v_r, v_\theta, v_\phi) \\
\vec{\omega} &= (\omega_r, \omega_\theta, \omega_\phi).
\end{align*}

To reduce complication, we take the billiard to be initially in
contact with the cone and in motion, as though the sphere has just
undergone a collision with the immediate surface. Given initial values
of \(\vec{r}\), \(\vec{v}\), and the gravitational strength \(g\), we may
compute the time (\(\tau\)) until the next collision with the cone as
the smallest positive root of the cubic equation [CITE]:

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{4}g^2\tau^3-gv_z\tau^2+\left(v_z^2-gz-v_{xy}^2\cot^2\theta\right)\tau+2z\left(v_z+v_{xy}\cos\varphi\cot\theta\right)=0.
\end{equation}
Cartesian notation is used here only for brevity, where
\(z=r\cos\theta\), \(\vec{v}=(v_x,v_y,v_z)\), in conjunction with
the ordinary cylindrical representation of the velocity:
\begin{align*}
v_{xy} &= \sqrt{v_x^2+v_y^2} \\
\varphi &= \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{v_y}{v_x}\right) \\
v_z &= v_z
\end{align*}
Though the desired root of this cubic equation may be expressed
analytically via a reduction to the depressed form and substitution of
a triple angle formula [CITE], we have found no clear insight offered
there other than for computational simplicity.  With the correct
flight time and gravitational acceleration, application of regular
three-dimensional kinematics to the initial state
\(\vec{\psi}=(\vec{r},\vec{v},\vec{\omega})\) yields a transformation to
the new state of the billiard \(\vec{\psi}\rightarrow\vec{\psi}'\), just
prior to impact.

\section{Collisions}
\label{sec:orge5da9fc}

[Overview]

\subsection{The Impulse Model}
\label{sec:org3b4ab16}

Since our analysis rests on the assumption that any redirection occurs
instantaneously, this ideal billiard must then be effectively
incompressible, making contact with the cone only ever at a single
point (\(P\)). From this, it follows that any collision between the
sphere and the cone is identical to one between that sphere and a flat
surface which is tangent to the cone at the point \(P\) (and also
parallel to the to the \$r\(\phi\)\$-plane).

This situation of a sphere and a hard plane has been already been
solved by Kane and Levinson, where ordinary conditions
for slipping and sticking are considered. Such a model will be the
general framework of our collision simulations, including our own
revisions to the model and further simplifications.

First we will begin with the simplest of such simulations, admittedly most 
deviant from physical reality, included only for ease of analysis.

 \{I\}\(_{\parallel}\)\$ and \(\scr{I}_\perp\),
representing the impulse \(\vec{R}_p = R\hat{\theta}\), and
\(\hat{\theta}\) represents a unit vector in the direction of increasing
spherical coordinate \(\theta\).

Next, with the incident state known, we split the impulse vector into
perpendicular and parallel components with respect to the plane that
is tangent to the cone at \(P\), of the cone, various cases for the
exit velocities of a billiard. Those cases by first considering two
basic components
