In brief, the message of the article in question is on the concept of
the landscape in geography and how affects the culture of it's human
inhabitants. Specifically, plazas in Honduras are shown to serve as
landscapes of environmental communication and play a role in sending
specific messages about forests and forest issues in the country
\cite{bass2005message}. It has been worth noting a recurring theme in
the paper, that is the idea of the landscape as "both regulating and
reflecting." Regulatory in the sense that trees in the newly
"landscaped" plazas as discussed serve as a constant reminder to the
people of Honduras that deforestation is an issue, while also
reflecting messages to an outsider about the culture's sacred feelings
toward the environment.

Bass begins the article mentioning a phrase he encountered on a bumper
sticker while conducting his research in Tegucigalpa which reads "We'd
better plant some trees or we're screwed." In the next section titled,
"Public Sentiment and the Forest Landscape," the author is met with
the sentiment that life has gotten better for Hondurans since the
1950s, given various technological improvements. Despite this,
however, he notices that ecological concerns have spread throughout
the culture that did not seem to be present more than twenty years
prior. Bass admits that "many Hondurans" that he had conversed with
all expressed a sentiment that deforestation was a serious problem.

Here is where Bass steps back and expresses possible explanations for
this idea being so prevalent, one being the idea that certain
indigenous groups tend to hold dear any sources of perceived benefit,
including but not limited to grassroots-type perspectives and the
conservationist ideals of foreigners who continually have provided aid
to Honduran communities in more recent years. 

Tying the academics back into the analysis, Bass talks about the
general concept of the landscape in geography with reference to the
progression of the idea throughout the history of the field. Most
importantly, he identifies other geographers' descriptions of
landscape as both "a thermostat and a thermometer," identifying the
Latin American plazas as a kind of monument that is, again, "both
regulating and reflecting."

Bass has established his credibility throughout the paper, elucidating
the details of plaza landscapes as well as the historic context in
which this culture is being observed. Though there seem to be a few
points that do not obviously contribute to his message, the largest
piece of evidence provided seems to be the author's
"repeat-photography study," which illuminates the impact that the
culture has on the plazas, and likewise how the plazas, as effective
advertisements of social reform, have so greatly influenced the
culture.
