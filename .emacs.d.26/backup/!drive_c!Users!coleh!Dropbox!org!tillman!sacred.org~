Growing up in Austin, Texas, the most obvious example of a violent
event which shaped the city would have to be the well-known University
of Texas Tower shooting in 1966. In fact, it has been quite difficult
to find any other instances of sacred spaces in Austin which came
about due to a tragic event. In my quest for something less known, I
approached my mother and father about the idea who both recalled a
specific tree seated just near downtown Austin called the Treaty Oak.

Looking at the wiki, the Treaty Oak is apparently one of fourteen
original trees that together formed a grove known to the Texas natives
as the Council Oaks, some 300 years ago cite:wiki. On what looks like
an old copper plaque which is still posted in front of the tree today,
it is also stated that the grove was the site of the first boundary
treaty between Natives and Europeans in Texas, though it may be that
no historical records exist which support this cite:wiki. I imagine
that it is also questionable whether or not the Comanche and Tonkawa
tribes had used this unique landscape as a sacred meeting place for
launching raids and peace treaties, or that the 7th governor of Texas
Sam Houston actually did once rest under the Treaty Oak during the
American Civil War cite:wiki. In either case, such tales as I have
found reading various accounts of the tree seem to play a huge part in
reflecting the admiration that Austinites have expressed for the tree
over the years. But it was one year in particular which came to
sharply ignite the bond between the city and this beloved tree, such
that, at least in my family, it has become a household name.

The story goes in a similar manner all across the web. It is 1989 and
the Treaty Oak stands as the last remaining member of the original
fourteen Council Oaks, "the most perfect specimen of a tree in North
America" cite:plaque. Nestled on the side of the road in a small park
just outside of downtown Austin, its branches spreading a distance of
127 feet across, people familiar with the area had started to notice
oak wilt and dying leaves. Soon after, it was discovered upon
investigation of the soil that the tree had been deliberately poisoned
at its base with an extremely large amount of Velpar herbicide.

School children began sending letters, Native Americans in the area
brought song and ritual, a herbicide manufacturer established a
$10,000 bounty on the felon, and Texan billionaire Ross Perot gave a
blank check to the local team tasked with saving the tree
cite:wiki,statesman. A majority of the main branches had to be
removed, and several small trees were planted around the Treaty Oak in
hopes that they would be able to nurse it back to health. For eight
years following the attack the tree still struggled to survive, each
year passing without a single new crop of acorns cite:culturemap.

When asked about how someone poisoning a tree could have possibly
qualified as a tragic event, my mother replied in seriousness,
describing frequent news coverage and televised vigils. One photograph
from the same year as the poisoning shows a group of psychics
conducting a "transferrance of energy" ritual on the tree
cite:statesman. An article from the News 8 Austin website can also be
found on the online web archive for 2004, which describes the
dedication of one particular spiritual admirer of Native American
culture, "Frank Stronghorse," who claims to have used a medicine pipe
to "bring balance back to the tree" cite:news8.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Once you have identified a site, consider its current status. Is it
sanctified, is it obliterated, or does it fall somewhere in between?
Elements of the landscape, such as signs or monuments (or their lack)
will indicate that status of the site.

Take note of any debates that have occurred about what to do with this
site. Has the status of the site changed over time? How?
