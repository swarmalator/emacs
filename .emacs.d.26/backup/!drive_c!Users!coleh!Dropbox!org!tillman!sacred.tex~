Growing up in Austin, Texas, the most obvious example of a violent
event I know of which shaped the city would have to be the University
of Texas Tower shooting in 1966. In fact, it has been quite difficult
to find any other instances of large-scale heinous crimes in Austin
from more than a couple years ago. In my quest for something less
known, I approached my mother and father about the idea who both
recalled a specific tree seated just near downtown Austin called the
Treaty Oak.

Looking at the wiki, the Treaty Oak is apparently one of fourteen
original trees that together formed a grove known to the Texas natives
as the Council Oaks, some 300 years ago \cite{wiki}. On what looks like
an old copper plaque which is still posted in front of the tree today,
it is stated that the grove was the site of the first boundary treaty
between Natives and Europeans in Texas, though it may be that no
historical records exist which support this \cite{wiki}. I imagine that
it is also questionable whether or not the Comanche and Tonkawa tribes
had used this unique landscape as a sacred meeting place for launching
raids and peace treaties, or that the 7th governor of Texas Sam
Houston actually did once rest under the Treaty Oak during the
American Civil War \cite{wiki}. In either case, such tales as I have
found reading various accounts of the tree seem to play a huge part in
reflecting the admiration that Austinites have expressed for it over
the years. But it was one year in particular which came to sharply
ignite the bond between the city and this beloved tree, such that, at
least for my parents who lived on the opposite side of town, it had
become a household name.

The story seems to go in a similar manner in various places all around
the web. It is 1989 and the Treaty Oak stands as the last remaining
member of the original fourteen Council Oaks, "the most perfect
specimen of a tree in North America" \cite{plaque}. The tree was huge,
poised to the side of the road in a small park just outside of
downtown Austin. Its branches spreading a distance of 127 feet across,
estimated by the Texas Chamber of Commerce to be somewhere around 600
years old \cite{pfufc}. Sometime during this year, people familiar with
the area had started oak wilt in its branches and leaves which were
shedding out of season. Soon after, it was discovered upon
investigation of the soil that the tree had been deliberately poisoned
at its base with an extremely large amount of Velpar herbicide, enough
to kill 100 trees \cite{culturemap}.

Word got around quickly, as school children began sending letters,
Native Americans in the area brought song and ritual, a herbicide
manufacturer established a \$10,000 bounty on the felon, and Texan
billionaire Ross Perot even gave a blank check to the local team
tasked with saving the tree \cite{wiki,statesman}. The puzzle of
avoiding the supposedly hundred-fold lethal dose did attract national
attention among arbor experts, some coming to join with locals in what
was called the "Treaty Oak Task Force" \cite{culturemap,pfufc}.

When asked about how someone poisoning a tree could have possibly
qualified as a tragic event, my mother replied in seriousness,
describing frequent news coverage and televised vigils. One photograph
from the same year as the poisoning shows a group of psychics who came
from Dallas and Waco to conduct a "transference of energy" ritual on
the tree, hoping to "release negative energy fron the tree into the
universe" \cite{statesman}. An article from the News 8 Austin website
can also be found on the online web archive for 2004, which describes
the dedication of one particular spiritual admirer of Native American
culture, "Frank Stronghorse," who claims to have used a medicine pipe
to "bring balance back to the tree" \cite{news8}. It turns out that the
actual poisoning of the tree was intended to be part of some sort of
black-magic love ritual. The offender ended up being caught and sent
to prison where he stayed for 9 years.

While testimony alone should not be sufficient to illuminate the true
reaction of the city, the sheer volume of these which have appeared in
researching the subject, each conveying a deep admiration for the same
especially historic landmark, indicate that this old oak has with no
doubt become a sacred piece of Austin's geographical history.

"Bend but unbowed," the Treaty Oak still stands today
\cite{bullock}. With the majority of its main branches having been
removed during its fight, its former glory is dearly missed
\cite{pfufc}. The complex process of treating the Treaty Oak has also
been well documented and studied, with the task force also including
22 Ph.D. professional foresters and support from The American Forestry
Association \cite{pfufc}. Decisions that were made during the process
can also be seen today, as there are many small trees closely
surrounding the Treaty oak, planted there to help nurse the Treaty Oak
back to health \cite{pfufc}. It wasn't until eight years after the
attack, in 1997, that the oak was finally able to producing its own
crop of acorns \cite{culturemap}.

There is another kind of beauty in the story of the Treaty Oak, in
that there is no written account of the poisoning posted at the
park. Still the same copper plaque from old times stands, with a
non-intrusive green chain-post fence surrounding the base. Unfamiliar
onlookers may not see anything other than a large and curiously tilted
oak in the middle of a park, while members of the culture feel a much
deeper connection not just to the landscape but the history,
community, and spirit of Austin, Texas.

\begin{quote}
Austinites feel that Treaty Oak pretty much sums up the story of who we are as a community: strong, resilient, courageous, a little off-center, and here to stay \cite{bullock}.
