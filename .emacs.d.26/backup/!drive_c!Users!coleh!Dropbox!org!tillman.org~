-  of landscape 

**** Slides
***** Geo/Graphy Human and Physical
- The study of *place*-physical and human
- *Regions*
- Studies *space*: the *location* and *distribution* of features on the *Earth's surface* 
- Studies *Human activity*, the *natural environment*, and the *relationship* between the two (perception)
- Geography's special nature: *Location, Location, Location*
- Explains the *why* of *where*
***** What is cultural geography?
- What is culture?
    - Learned patterns of human behavior held in common by a group of people
    - Components: beliefs, institutions, technology
        - (language, religion, food, clothes, manners etc.)
    - Culture as a process: dynamic mix of symbols, beliefs, language, practices (what is a sub-culture?)
- *Cultural Geography* studies the relationships between space, place, environment, and culture.
- Cultural variation is sometimes explained by the physical
  environment. Cultural geography offers a spatial perspective as well
  as an ecological one. Physical environment and wheat cultivation,
  human modification of climatic effects
***** Formal Culture Regions
- Areas of the earth's surface marked by a certain degree of homogeneity in one or more phenomena.
- Scientific devices that enable us to make spatial generalizations
- Based on criteria we establish
    - Human (cultural)
    - Physical (natural)
    - or Both
    - Core-periphery
    - Borders are zones

    - "globalization /is/ diffusion"
**** Relocation Diffusion
- The spread of an innovation or other element of culture that occurs
  with the bodily relocation (migration, shipping) of an individual...
**** Expansion Diffusion
**** Hierarchical Diffusion
- When ideas or innovations spread by "trickling down" from larger to
  smaller adopting units
- An *urban hierarchy* or "important person"
- innovations leapfrog over wider areas, with geographic distance a
  less important factor
**** Contagious Diffusion
- When an innoavtion spreads by person to person contact, moving
  wave-like through the area and population, without regard to social
  status
- "West Nile Virus in the United States, 1999 - 2002"
- Spread of bubonic plague in Europe
- Dr. Snow's 1854 map of 578 chloera deaths in London
- Can Contagious and Hierarchical Diffusion occur at the same time?
**** Stimulus Diffusion
- Siberian reindeer herders and stimulus diffusion
- *Stimulus Diffusion*: when the specific trait is rejected but the
  underlying idea is accepted (Ex. Siberian reindeer herders)
**** Diffusion
- *time-distance decay*: Acceptance generally decreases with distance
  and time (ripples)
- *Absorbing and permeable barriers*: Laws, rules, and cultural norms

**** Summarizing the Bass Article
+ There is a disconnect between perception and actual landscape
+ How did these plazas change over time
    - Mid 1990s tree planting makes plaza more recreational
    - Described the plazas as "parks"
    - Social center of town
    - Psychological center of town
    - Geographic center of town
    - All kinds of important social events occur here
+ What is the methodology
    - Repeat photography
    - Compares perception to reality
    - Testimony vs. photographic evidence
    - 1957 vs. 2001
    - "Gives hard evidence to counteract people's perception"
    - Trees before and trees after, but might not be the same kind of trees
    - Showcases changing culture in general through diffusion of forest conservation ideas
+ Why did people think there were fewer trees when photos showed more?
    - Condensed placement
    - The message in the plaza
    - "If we don't plant more trees we're screwed"
    - Bumper stickers, media
    - diffusion of an environmental message from the outside
+ Weakness of methodology?
    - Just shows a slice in time
    - maybe there were more trees than there are there
    - Don't have a picture every year / no precise knowledge
+ What does author mean by "advertising works"
    - Reflecting that the campaign has been successful
    - Trees were an advertisement for conservation
    - Parks or "Garden parks"
+ What themes (of the 5 course themes) relate to this article?
    - Nature/Culture (Human environment interaction)
    - Cultural Landscape
**** Cultural Ecology
- Studies the relationship between the environment and culture (adaptive system).
- "The interplay between humans and the environment"
- How do we influence the environment?
- How do we adapt to the environment?
**** Environmental Determinism
- The view that the natural environment has a controlling influeence
  over various aspects of human life, including cultural development.
- "Mountain regions discourage the budding of genius because they are
  areas of isolation, confinement, remote from the great currents of
  men and ideas that move along the river valleys... The two
  contrasted enviroments [mountain ranges and river valleys] produce
  directly certain economic and social results, which in turn become
  the causes of secondary intellectual and artistic effects."
- "The Eskimo's hell is a place of darkness, storm and intense cold;
  the Jew's is a place of eternal fire."
**** Response to Determinism
- *Sequent Occupance*: The fact that different peoples have occupied the
  same places, in sequence, at different times, and have lived very
  different times, and have lived very different lifestyles.
- Example: Was coal a resource for Native Americans
- *Possibilisim*: The notion that every natural environment has certain
  possibilities and limitations, but it is the people who choose among
  the possibilities, according to their cultural values, attitudes,
  skills, and level of technology.
**** Possibilism and urban morphology
- *Environmental perception*- filter of culture, experience, goals, technology
**** Humans as Modifiers of the Earth
- /The Aral Sea, An Ecological Disaster/
**** Environmental Perception
- Natural Hazards
    - Denial
    - Fatalism
    - Time interval, technology
**** Cultural Interaction (not in textbook)
- The notion that all aspects of culture are intertwined.
    - Religious belief may influence voting, diet, shopping patters,
      type of employment, social standing

- Language vs. Dialect?
- Ethnic Groups and National Boundaries
    - *Lingua Franca*: a language of trade and commerce
    - Swahili is an east African Lungua Franca
    - Colonial languages are also Lingua Francas

Aramaic languages have almost died out. (The language spoken at around
the time of Christ). Latin is no longer spoken but lives on in
different forms. Talking about Indo-European family, Afro-Asiatic
Family and Other families of languages. Textbook diagram, "mother
tongue" tree figure. Another diagram in the text "Ten Leading
Languages in Numbers of Native Speakers." Most European languages are
just named after the country, with some exceptions. Switzerland speaks
Romanche, French, Italian, /not/ Swiss. Austria speaks German. Belgium
has two different languages: Waloon (modified French) and Flemish (dialect of
Dutch). 

/Language is perhaps the most unifying aspect of culture/.

Romance languages come from Rome (not the common use of /romantic/ or
anything). There's a northwest pattern of germanic language, how is
English a Germanic language? English were originally Germanic tribes
which were forces into west Europe. East Europe has a general Slavic
pattern. Why is Romania more isolated from the other Romantic
languages? The clue is in the name -- it's a leftover part of the Roman
Empire.

It's believed that the Basque is a surviving language from a much
older time in Europe. Possibly used the mountains as an absorbing
barrier to language diffusion.

Looking at a map of dialects within the United States and
Canada. Midland is split: part of the midland is more like the north,
and part like the south. Eastern and Northern borders of Spanish
dialects. Maybe cattle trails like the chisolm trail affects boundary
lines? None really exist in East Texas. "US word variation & New York
Times dialect quiz." /soda/ vs. /pop/ vs. /coke/ vs. /soft drink/. 

Linguistic diffusion map of the eastern hemisphere. Indo-European,
Afro-Asiatic, Austronesian, and Niger-Congo sources. 

Concepts of Lingustic Ecology, one being when the physical geography
influences the language. The examples of Spanish words which describe
mountains or hills. Ejectives, click-type noises in languages with at
a higher elevation (some contradictory data as well, perhaps not just
the elevation). Lunguistic refuge area tend to be remote areas or
places of physical geography tht conquering armies did not want to go
to. Places that were more remote and isolated for whatever
reason. Examples are the old celtic fringe, "Irish Gaelic" and "Scots
Gaelic." U.S. examples are the remote islands off of the east coast,
escaped slaves in the island refuge known as the "Gola." Flat plains
cause more uniform distributions of language, mountains are more
isolated, less uniform. Caucasia is a linguistic refuge area and
"shatterbelt," where different ideologies/countries meet. 

Toponyms or place names are a clue to cultural history. They give a
clue about the people of the past. Sometimes there are generic and
specific toponyms. Languages can affect how you feel or interact with
a place, especially if the language is less familiar. A generic place
name would be like the "Fort" in the specific place name of Fort
Worth. /Naming is claiming/. Why do different places want Antarctica?
Exclusive economic zones, potential future resources (fishing and oil
for the most part). Another clue to culture history is this map of
Arabic toponyms in the Iberian peninsula. Note that the nothern Basque
area was never fully conquered (700 years of Islamic nation control
here). Coastal areas to East dispersed along easier access routes.

Texas is quite bizarre in it's place names. Using Honduras as an
example, the north coast trade winds (binging trading ships from
Europe) are so consistent that Hondurans sometimes say "arriba" and
"abajo" instead of East and West to indicate the direction that they
travel (upwind vs downwind). One city names after a king who burnt a
town down. One village named after a rum-drunken woman who hurt
herself once and people heard about it, "Rumdin" for rum-drunk.

Chapter 5 Ethnic Geography: Homelands and Islands

Talking about how different cultural foods have been modified to fit
Amercian tastes. Race and Ethnicity have very different meanings. Are
they social constructions, not biological fact? Anthropologists in the
1800s measured the facial features of different races and found that
the statistical differences between members of the same "race" have a
broader spread than differences between races. This is a blurry
topic - what do you think about it? Okay but there are some biological
differences between races (are we not all part of the /human/
race?). Spanish categorization of the early Mexican culture. Brazil
has somewhere around 50 different racial categories, /but it depends on
who is doing the categorization/. One school of thought (the prevailing
one) is of socially constructed races. Another says that social
construction occurs up to a point, while some traits are genetically
determined and significant.

Ethnic groups
1. People of common ancestry and cultural tradition
2. Different identifying traits-language, religion etc.
3. Usually a minority population (often become ethnic after
   immigrating from their homeland)

Ethnicity is self-identified, written down by each person on a
census. Society uses skin color (mostly) to identify ethnic groups. 

Ethnic Homelands is where you have majority populations of a certain
ethnic group. Looking at the Inuit homeland, Nunavat.
1. Cover large areas
2. Typically have some political autonomy
3. Most belong to indigenous ethnic groups

Ethnic Islands (Stromsburg - Swede Capital of Nebraska)
1. Numerous but small
2. Minimal interaction with other groups
3. Land is inherited
Where are ethnic islands in Texas? Muenster, TX (West of Gainsville,
settled by Catholic Germans). Looking at churches and catholic schools
located in Muenster, keeping a German feel. Example: unique
celebration of April Oktoberfest.

Why do Ethnic Culture Regions occur? A bridge into the new culture,
helps to assimilate, know where to get food and essentials and more.

1. Ethnic Neighborhood
     - Residents have much in common
     - people reside by choice
     - Transitory population undergoing acculturation
2. Ghettos (and other stuff)

Settlement and Environment
- *pre-adaptation*: A complex of adaptive traits and skills possessed in
  advance of migration by a group, giving them survival ability and a
  competitive advantage in colonizing the new environment
- Migrants select site similar to homeland

Looking at map of English, Cornish, Native Americans, Icelanders, and
Finns that settle in geographical places that are more similar to
their hometown -- they tend to do so (if they can). Pre-adaptation has
occurred in Texas as well with Czech farmers. Looking at a map of
Ethnic and National Origin Groups. Looking at 1990s and 2000 census
results. Why don't we speak German if they are the most populous
ethnic group? *Law of first effective Settlement*, the English were the
first to settle and establish the language. The cultural foundation is
British (English), and therefore people who have migrated here after
the founding have to adopt into that. From 1990s to 2000, population
did not self identify as German nearly as much (23.3% to 13.8%). Also
could be explained partially because of the older population which is
losing members, children intermarry or otherwise lose a sense of
cultural identity with Germany. Looking at statistical estimates for
2016, note that "White alone" accounts for 76.9% while "White alone,
not Hispanic" accounts for 61.3%. Other ones are interesting as well,
will go over deeper tomorrow.

Cultural Geography
Hemphill Mapping Project: Part 2

Fort Worth's La Gran Plaza mall has a rich history of cultural and economic adaptation. First erected in 1962 as the Seminary South Shopping Center, the mall was the first to be built in Fort Worth. Despite initial successes, the mall began to experience a decline in customer traffic by the late 1980s. At that time it was known as the Fort Worth Town Center, where other centers like the Hulen and Ridgemar malls had started to gain in popularity. Originally catering to the general American public, large stores including J.C. Penny, Dillards, and Sears had begun leaving the Fort Worth Town Center in the late 1990s due to the increased competition. Then in 2004, operating with only a 10 percent occupancy rate, the property was purchased by José de Jesús Legaspi, who had decided to reinvent the mall as La Gran Plaza. The new name then began to attract Mexican-catered stores, which in turn attracted the nearby hispanic community, ultimately leading to the mall's revival as a unique cultural and economic center that still thrives today.
 
La Gran Plaza represents a variety of different ethnic groups including Americans and the Chinese, with the most dominant group being of Mexican heritage. We observed each of these ethnic groups as both employees and customers, the Gran Plaza also presenting an assortment of Spanish advertisements and posters, often providing English translations, and occasionally even Chinese. Generally, it seemed that the Mexican restaurants and shops were what made up the majority of the mall, including several dress shops which sold dresses specifically for the celebration of the Quinceañera, a rite of passage in Latin American tradition centered around a girl's 15th birthday (similar to the "Sweet Sixteen" in the U.S.). These same stores seemed to also market wedding attire in addition to that for the Quinceañera. As we continued spectating, we spotted American eateries such as Auntie Annie's Pretzels and a some places to buy western-influenced apparel. The presence of American popular culture was also noted, one example being a life-size C-3PO which stood atop an escalator in the central market area of the mall. Interestingly, the life size C-3PO was not gold, it was maroon, possibly indicating a mixing of cultures. Additional indicators of the presence of American culture were American footwear stores, a GameStop, and a Ross. Eastern influence was seen throughout the mall as well, there being a Chinese-styled massage parlor, reflexology clinic, martial arts studio, and a gift shop with lucky elephants and chakra posters.

La Gran Plaza certainly has a mix of services that cater to each of the ethnic groups local to South Fort Worth. The Spanish, English, and Chinese languages have all been utilized which make the mall itself a more universal gathering site. The Plaza represents hybrid culture through its attention to the past and the present, also holding an event about Elvis Presley called "Elvis: The Experience." Additionally, there is an ATT store which is part of American culture, but in this mall ATT is called ATT: Mi Movil (Translation: my cellphone).

World Population Trends (~7.6 Billion)
- Is the world overpopulated?
- Is population growth uniform or is population shrinknig in som countries?
- When is world population growth projected to peak, if ever?
- Will the world's population ever shrink?
- Why does familiy size vary between high and low income countries?
- Does the world produce enough food to feed everyone?
World Population Cartogram, 2015
Malthus' Theory of Population Growth
- In 1798 Thomas Malthus published his views on the effect of
  population on food supply. His theory has two basic principles:
- Population grows as a *geometric* rate
- Food production increases at an *arithmetic* rate

"The power of population is so superios to the power of the Earth to
produce subsistence for man, that premature death must in some shape
or other visit the human race." -- Thomas Malthus, 1789

"If the present growth trends in world population, industrializes,
pollution, food production, and resource depletion continue unchanged,
the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within
the next 100 years." -- The Club of Rome think tank, 1972

What is GREEN REVOLUTION?
- *green revolution* refers to a large increase in crop production by
  using modern agricultural techniques

So much food
- "We produce so much food that we put it into our gas tanks."
- Corn is currently used to produce the ethanol in gasoline
- One penny per pound of potatos caused farmers to not harvest planted
  crops (it wasn't worth it)

Are Humans Resources?
- "Necessity is the mother of invention"
- *carrying capacity* is the maximum number of people that can be supported in a given area
- "the Conditions of Agricultural Growth" by Ester Boserup
- Ester Boserup 1965
    - Boserup believed people have the resources of knowledge and technology to increase food supplies
    - Opposite to Malthus
    - more intensive systems and used when the population grew
    - Demographic pressure promotes innovation (irrigation, weeding, crop intensification, better seeds, tools, and techniques)
- "The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate..." - 1968
- "The Population Bomb" by Dr. Paul R Ehrlich
- "The Ultimate Resource" by Julian L. Simon

Demographic Transition Model
- Who is no longer dying? *the infants*
- Why does the birth rate drop? Transition from a rural society to an
  urban society, (dont need more farm hands)
- "Each child costs $250,000 in the United States"
- Italy was the first country to have more people older than 60 than younger than 20
- There are fewer and fewer people paying into social security

Geography of Agriculture
- Why do geographers study agriculture?
    - The ultimate human-environment interaction (after geophagy)
    - Humankind's most basic need: how to get food
    - Relates to cultural geography's five themes
- Colombian Exchange
    - *Plant Domestication*: tranformation of a wild plant into a
      cultivated crop through selection to gain control over food
      production
    - *Relocation Diffusion*: The spread of an innovation or other
      element of culture that occurs with the bodily relocation
      (migration) of the individual or group responsible for the
      innovation
    - *Indigenous Technical Knowledge*: Highly localized knowledge about
      environmental conditions and sustainable land-use practices
- Mesoamerican Hearth
    - Culture Hearths and early diffusion routes (hearth, sphere of
      interaction, major direction of flow of ideas)

Alright now I am working as a group with Sarah and Joey for this cultural geography final
project. What is our topic? Cruise tourism and how it shapes something?

Cruise Tourism
- How can we understand why certain regions of the world have become popular cruise destinations
  while other regions seem to have less appeal?
- How has the cruise industry affected industries, services, and development?
- How does the cruise industry affect the natural environment?
- In what ways has the cruise industry altered the cultural landscape?

A cruise makes as much impact on the community as a small city

Cruise industry is basically the industry of selling geography

Starting with the idea that the cruise industry basically sells landscapes, a way for westerners to
satisfy their curiosities toward exotic /regional/ geography. Then we will touch on the idea that the
industry has become increasingly marketable (leading to an apparent haziness between a cruise line
selling the /destination/, versus selling their /itinerary/), especially in the Caribbean. This project
focuses on the growing economy of cruise tourism in the Caribbean and how it has.
