I'm some guy who has made lists of the things he tends to think about and put them on this website - currently under construction.

When I think of science, I also think of:
- Intellectual humility
- GÃ¶del's theorem and problems with metaphysics
- The skeptic de-converting from religion
- Epistemological humility
- Overcoming confirmation bias and fear of the unknown
- Wonder, curiosity, and "kicks in the discovery"
- Questioning absolutely everything, /including but not limited to yourself/
