#+TITLE: Thoughts

The thoughts here are to be unfiltered, unedited and true - likely including whatever incoherent babble comes to mind and plenty of typos. I had in mind that this might be good for my own self-reflection (and perhaps some sort of mental accountability?) and maybe mildly interesting to whoever else might be wandering here. I kind of like to think of it as an experiment in self-correction by being fully open and honest - or something like that.
