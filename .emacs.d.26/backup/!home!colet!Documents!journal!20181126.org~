I am in the country and I have not written a journal entry in forever. Last time I did was when I was still using the Windows operating system. I was starting to work on a literate haskell partial differential equations solver earlier today but had difficulties starting the internet connection and ended up playing red dead redemption instead. Fixed the drone today as well, and then lit a fire after the sun went down. Grilled some chicken over the fire and then watched some YouTube videos under the stars. Was cool to see the NASA technicians reacting to the InSight module which landed on Mars today and then look up and see the red planet above me. 

Might want to figure out a way to get spell check working on this machine while I type stuff like this.

I don't know why I hesitate so much before deciding to write to myself because I really and finding this refreshing at the moment. Perhaps it is just fun to be typing again.

Sort of figured something out today that I likely will later decide is not figured out and that is that I do not know. At some basic level it seems that I really think alongside whatever Greek philosopher said it first and that is that I know only one thing, that I know nothing.

I also think about Carl Sagan and one idea he seems to have promoted which is that we are all wanderers. 

I want to make something that I can upload to the internet. Might just be continuing with my website that no one visits or some YouTube channel or something like that. 

Perhaps I want to make something that others will find useful. Given that we are all wanderers, it might be a great benefit to just offer information that may help some people navigate with a little more light. Offering my take on something.

I have contemplated publishing everything that I think on to my website and/or YouTube channel, including whatever projects I work on regardless of the reasons I might have for doing so. Still I am not to keen on the idea for some unknown reason. 

If I could conveniently strap a GoPro on my head and wear it, recording 24/7 for future reference, I would. Perhaps I could invest in a wearable camera or time lapse device similar to this.
