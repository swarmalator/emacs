Do I fear writing words? Why don't I seem to like this? something about writing the words down makes me think about thoughts from english class. I want to have no certainty in what I write. Everything I write down is not really what I think anymore, just what I thought when I write it. Meditative. In a meditative state now. Perhaps it makes sense only to write my opservations of myself. Those I can be much more uncertain about with more ease. But that last statement wasnt one that was observational. It seems that those are easier, is perhaps what I meant to say. 

I wish to make no assertions. I now feel happier with myself writing in this way. I seem to have trouble assesing my own self-importance. I am not sure if the problem is one of too much or to little, but perhaps just that it is frequently occupying my mind as a question. How smart are you? Are you doing what a smart person would do? Are you secretly a genius? Have you been misled into thinking that you are actually smarter than the average person?

I must remember this point of view when deciding to type to myself. Maybe there is a way to maintain this perspective when not writing to myself. Earlier, it seemed I was reluctant to title the timers on my timer app. I think this could be foolish behavior. Why would instructing my future self come with such discomfort?

I seem to be thinking a lot. Truth and not making claims of it. The Shed and how it looks like a dance hall. Has gardening tools that I used to plant carrots and onions. Ways of speaking more humbly. Time is running out. Death is coming eventually. Spotify wont work on 32 bit Ubuntu. When I say 'is' it really means 'seems like'. 

What do I name the timers? Watching Joe Rogan now.
