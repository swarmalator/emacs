I still play rocket league even after that bit of typing to myself last night. Just was playing and had one of those moments where I imagine how easy it would be to just stop playing and then in that instant I start doing that. 

I want to do something that I believe in, or work on improving something that I believe in. I was contemplating whether or not to apply for a middle school science teaching job and after a walk around the pasture decided that I couldn't allow myself to do it. Decisions can change, of course. I want to be on the internet in some fashion producing some things that interest me. I am very interested in theoretical physics and deeper philosophical questions that it raises. It seems most of what I am interested in is thoughts, rather than things. I would love to be self-sustaining just offering my thoughts to the world, perhaps like some sort of teaching. I had this thought while walking back to the house today. I would want to get whatever value there is out of my own interpretations of things. 

What jobs are there where you might get paid to interpret stuff, as opposed to making stuff? Sounds an awful lot like theoretical work and being a research scientist. Would that mean that I should really be going to graduate school, then? Are there any other options?

"Just a Theory" - potential YouTube channel name?

I think that first things first, I should spend a lot more time on this than I do on video games. Might be a great idea to just remove them, though this has not worked out well for me in the past. Have to find some balance between just filming whatever comes to my mind and making sure that it is worthwhile before I film. The idea of being a "science YouTuber" sounds great. 

I would like to get video of me typing here somehow, or a video about my "second brain" in Emacs. Maybe that will come if anyone actually becomes interested in what I do.

I want to be able to explain concepts well, in a way that many people can understand. I also want to be able to teach math along with complex topics in a way that doesn't scare people off. That is such a hard thing, I imagine. 

Another thing I think is important, and surely relates to these other things, is that I want to create or focus on ways that we can become more self-aware via technology. Emacs would be a great way for me to start with. 

How would someone come to the idea of self-awareness, though? Surely one would have to be sufficiently motivated to come to this. I am also interested, then, in how unmotivated individuals can come to take life seriously and come to value thinking as a useful pass-time. How to unlearn the impulse to escape into the technology, or to at least be in control of when and for how long the escapes happen. 

Of course this all would seem to lead back to mindfulness meditation, of course. I want to try and see if the core idea hidden in here isn't more simple than meditation. I am thinking that this may have something to do with speaking to others, and humility. There seem to be some truths that few people deny honestly, but when confronted with them through conversations with most other people, they act hypocritically or dismissively. If the person bringing up the simple truths is doing so with apparent humility and peace, perhaps the truths aren't so easily dismissed in the minds of the listeners. This seems to be how some voices online have spurred me to make changes in my own life. Makes me think of street epistemology.

science youtuber -> technical concept explainer -> self-awareness via tech -> mindfulness -> choosing to think -> motivation to change -> good faith   conversation on what matters.

How in the world could I start more good faith conversations? Get people motivated to talk to one another in good faith? With openness, honesty, sincerity, and thought. Perhaps it is instinctual not to operate in good faith, and to say what people want to hear or what needs to be said in order to produce certain outcomes that you want. Perhaps I should understand this mode of being more before I set out to pull people including myself away from it. 

Some interesting concepts to talk about with others seem to be lying and/or hypocrisy. What would a conversation with someone about lying look like? What about hypocrisy? I have actually had conversations about consistency with people before and have heard some very strange things. A certain conversation with John and Hank, I am remembering. 

One thing that Lisa and I have talked about when discussing making a change in one's thinking or behavior is the fear that by changing, we are willingly and by definition becoming a hypocrite. We are deciding to do something differently than we had decided previously. Perhaps this is where it becomes beneficial to have the skill of being able to admit when we are/were wrong. This concept I can refer to as fallibility. 

good faith -> lying & hypocrisy -> acknowledge fallibility 

Of course this can be viewed as analogous to the idea of original sin. I do believe that this is an extremely valuable belief to hold. It seems to also be a snake that bites it's own tail, for as firmly as you believe that you are imperfect, your own belief in your imperfections must then be imperfect as well, and thus subject to debate. This leads me to think that if anyone takes seriously the idea that we are at all times imperfect and/or original sinners, then it is only consistent that we do not take any of our beliefs to be absolutely True, for they are our imperfect beliefs. 

Now I am thinking about how important it might be to take part in projects that are difficult, and that require interaction with the physical world. By this I mean some technical work or crafting. Maybe it is the case that particularly challenging technical tasks can serve as a thermometer for one's level acceptance of their own fallibility, and thus their own self-awareness. I am talking about situations where reality does not match our expectations and we are forced to confront that fact if we want to complete the task. I imagine anxiety can ensue, denial, and whatever instinctual responses to cognitive dissonance there are. Makes me wonder what my most common poor response to such situations might be. 

I think that I often find ways to ignore the thoughts in my head, or at least simultaneously hold two opposing ideas despite any unevenness of truth there might be between them. Perhaps what I am not doing enough of is taking bets on these ideas, making a judgment, and then acting on that decision. What a more comfortable situation to not decide and to just keep thinking about the decision as if there is still any competition. 

Of course there is always potential for competition between any to views but this is also getting right into some thoughts that I am very familiar with regarding analysis paralysis and just "going with my gut." I think it is best to maintain perhaps a balance between these two. And here I think that it is also hugely important to include the meta-analysis in the analysis part. Questions like, should I still be thinking about this? 

We have looped back to a part of my mindfulness thoughts that involves being able to "zoom out" from whatever is currently occupying my attention. The movie theater as a dark room with people sitting and a projector analogy that I heard Sam Harris describe. To navigate layers of abstraction, or to at least be able to abstract/generalize in any situation.

fallibility -> technical work -> problem solving -> unmet expectations -> instinctual responses -> analysis paralysis -> meta-analysis fixes paralysis -> abstraction/generalization

How is it possible to teach people the skill of abstraction/generalization?
