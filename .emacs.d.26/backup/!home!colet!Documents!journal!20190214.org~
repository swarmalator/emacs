Working on Emacs stuff is great. Mind maps is good. I want to actually use the mind map stuff more if it works well, seems to be a great system. Wonder if there is anything that I can use it for at the moment. Old nonlinear dynamics stuff I remember. Well how about I just start thinking about the stuff that I have done and would like to do in Emacs and/or on the internet. 

I have been wanting to make some sort of YouTube channel. I think that my Emacs setup is pretty cool. I would want to share it with people on the web.
There are also a good amount of things that I believe in, though I don't know how I would like being really political at all. Perhaps just philosophical, in which case I would have the potential to look quite stupid. 

If I was anonymous, though, it could work really well and I could work on just artistic style pieces. Would not want to do any speaking really in this case. Typing, sure. 

Another way that I think I would enjoy would be to not ever have my voice on camera, but show video of myself and just voiceover. Describing what is happening or something to that effect. Preferably not posing or staging very many shots, though.

Audio is a much more digestible format than reading, however. If it is a video, perhaps there would be some sense to reading this. 

How fast could I type for the video though? Maybe just the sounds of me typing and then some music in the background. The video of me typing as well like this, video of the screen, that is. I wonder how awkward that would be. 

I am writing this as my first YouTube video. hopefully this format isn't to strange to people on the web. And I also hope that I don't make too many typing mistakes. I am only using the keyboard to type and edit this. 

Perhaps. This could be my more philosophical or artistic channel style. Have multiple channels.

Maybe I shouldn't plan out the video like a speech, but maybe just as a raw stream of consciousness. I have no idea how that would work. Would likely be boring for most people. No one wants to read the stuff, I am sure. Then again, people are in general more attentive if they are going to watch stuff like 3blue1brown. 

What would the audience be? Should I even try to consider an audience? Or perhaps I should just do my own thing and see if anyone becomes interested. 

Maybe the videos can have themes. What should I eat for dinner? 

This is a sample. Hopefully the typing isn't ridiculously loud. 

This might be a bit better. The canvas size apparently has an effect on the region of the screen that is captured? 

This typing would be pretty cool to capture, tbh. Going to a coffee shop and getting all of the audio.
