Thinking about systems that have built-in mechanisms for revision, taken into more human applications. Like planning out what someone is going to go consistently from day to day, or by week, including in this plan a certain amount of time devoted toward revising that very plan. Planned hypocrisy, or planned deviation might be better. In away it wouldn't be hypocritical to change one's plans if one had planned to change in the first place. 

It is not hypocritical to change one's plans if one plans to change.

It's a mechanism for self-correction, in my view. Though there of course should be criteria for what will cause change. Not sure if it would be beneficial to plan out times on a daily or weekly basis to make changes to my mind or plans for something. Seems a bit constricting to say that I have decided to act on my plans and will not consider changing until this other time sometime later. Maybe we are not meant to determine when we change?

But then there seems to be no real rules for change, if at any moment our state of mind would try to convince us we need to change something. Could be for emotional unthoughtful reasons. 

I think change is something that best happens when I am alone, and perhaps more meditative. Throughout the time that I am doing thing I might want to make notes to remember things that challenge my current way of doing things and then at some perhaps pre-decided time, I could reflect on all of these things and decide what to do about them. Is this what I am doing now by writing on my computer?

How uncomfortable might it be to reflect on all of the things that seemed to have caused conflict? Well, immediately I see that it would expectably cause mental conflict to bring these things up. 

I wonder what would need to happen for change to happen in people when they are not alone. Seems to be a recipe for manipulation. 

I might think it is appropriate not to ask people, verbally or not, to change their minds in front of you. I think that a more honest way to change one's mind is to do it when he/she is reflecting alone. Maybe it could be done in front of people, but it seems at least to be much harder to maintain a truly open and self-reflective state of mind when interacting with other people. 

Would it be worth it for me to try and get people to an open and self-reflective state of mind in front of me? Especially if they perhaps have not done this before, not even with themselves? Makes sense how it would be very difficult, confusing and vulnerable for the person. 

Ok so do I instruct people not to change their minds in front of me? Or perhaps reassure them that I am not trying to change their minds in this moment? Maybe leave out the in this moment part. One could say that I am trying to get someone to change his/her own mind. So is it dishonest to say that I am not trying to change people's minds, then? If one thing's for sure, I am trying to change my own mind. 

I think that we often don't have too much of a problem hearing conflicting or difficult information, we just have a difficult time honestly considering it when we are not under pressure. Maybe it's in people's desire not to be a hypocrit that they decide not to change their minds about things. But yep, it does seem like we in general do not like to realize that we have been wrong.

So, to conclude, as I probably should, I think that changing minds is a fickle thing. I don't want people to feel pressured into changing the way that they think while I am in conversation with them, but I think it is also important to encourage them to think about what bothers them in their own time. 

Generally, I think we try to avoid discovering that we are/were wrong about something. But it is important to realize that those discoveries are very good. So it is important to think honestly about the things that have caused past conflict in our minds. For some people it seems to be easier to do when alone, and perhaps others do it better around people, though it is possible for manipulation to occur there. At the moment manipulation seems to be a good reason not to try and do it when in conversation. 

Listen to everyone and follow no one. Question everything, including yourself.

Thinking about the Apple Clips app and possibly using that to log my days. Would like to take time lapses of myself going about my day but would probably have to use the GoPro, as I would likely need to use my phone some. Makes things harder to edit. 

Could use the clips app and just keep the videos on my phone. Would definitely want to consolidate videos that I take throughout the day on my phone and it would be a nice way to do it, deleting stuff as I make the clips. This would make it harder to incorporte OBS and any computer recording, though. Would probably want to keep it all on my phone if I do it the Clips way. 

I seem to be consistently dissapointed with the lack of tinkering/customizability within Apple applications. Clips is just one example, I would certainly change aspects of it if I could.

It is not easy to tell if I dislike taking live videos of myself speaking for any actually good reasons. Part of it tells me that it has something to do with staying humble. AvE has a channel where he doesn't show anyone's face and I actually do like that. He speaks to the camera, though, and I am not sure if I am so quick to decide on that. I think it might be worth a shot.

What would I want to see in my own videos?

Just had the idea of changing my YouTube channel name periodically, as the content changes. Don't want to be pinned down by just one name, but also don't want to make my channel impossible to search for. I like this idea a lot at the moment. 

Perhaps there should be a first part of the name that will never change, that would refer to the part of belief in self-correction. That would be a convenient way to offer a pronouncable name for the channel. BISC. IMNperfect. Self-revising, adapting. Evolving. EVO. EVO-p4mp3m

Self-help for the technically minded. The serious thinker, the analytical, the skeptic. 

Not really about self-help. It's about myself, and how I am trying to get better.

But the self-help bit is that the help has to come from the self. But that's cliche. I mean specifically that a self-correcting entity must have in some aspect of it's internal rules/instructions a mechanism for revising it's own rules/instructions. These rules/instructions for us are our beliefs. If we believe that our minds as a whole are subject to change, and we have some criteria for determining better or worse change, then we can get better. Not sure where to go from there or if the last bit makes any sense. Being open to change and then having criteria for change are probably very different things. 

Self-correction. Doing something and then realizing that it may have been done wrongly. Changing your mind is deliberate hypocrisy. Making up your mind, however, is not.

Nonlinear dynamics and equilibrium. Recursive mappings. Observation/action feedback loop.

The belief map and reality. We only have access to our map, and not reality itself. In addition to our projection of the real world, we must have a compass, or legend or some extra feature on the map that will guide us to revise our map, because it is not perfect. We are human, fallible, we are sinners. Every single part of our map is viewed through our own lens, and is thus subject to misinterpretation.

It seems some feel security in having other seemingly more perfect humans construct their maps or parts of their maps for them, so they then don't have to rely on a map of their own creation, also knowing they are imperfect. But it's not just our actions that are imperfect, it's equally if not more so our interpretations that are as well, so even if there was some perfect human from which a perfect belief map was taught to us, we would not be able to escape the fact that all information we receive gets tainted by our senses.
