Just got off the phone with Lisa, and just like how it happens in the past, once I get good ideas and into some project of mine, we manage to have the biggest and most important/difficult conversation yet. Going to think through it a bit here to set my mind straight before getting back into the video ideas. 

She said she needed my help. I think I did a pretty good job of not doing so ingenuously. I want her to be her best self, and I don't exactly know what that even looks like. I talked to her about being imperfect, and how we all are. I talked about how realizing that we are wrong is not fun, and we avoid it. Didn't quite get to the fact that making that realization is a good thing, because we can then change - well I actually did a little but in a more roundabout way. This talk did not have much affect, though. I actually think that she was not in much of a listening mood, but also stated that she needed help, which made it quite difficult to help through the phone. 

Might be worth writing her a letter in the mail soon. She did mention that it makes her sad that I do not do this more often, or that I have not ever. I do think that women seem to have quite different expectations about what one does. Honestly it seems that it often involves things that involve less of any intense thought or deep understanding.

I guess I do not believe that anyone can be entirely independent. We all do rely on each other every now and again, and we need to, to make sure we haven't gone mad for example. 

I am trying to write out what I think about self-correction, and just during this I failed to communicate what I think would help to my girlfriend. What a poorly timed failure, ha.

You are sad. Talking to someone who is sad, I must get in touch with something that the person really believes in, and use that to reason them out of not being sad. That is, if I insist on doing it reasonably and honestly. I do not enjoy imagining that using dishonest but more effective ways of making people feel better are optimal. But if it is not about me, then what should it matter that I contradict myself in expressing my love for someone? In that moment, I would have to make a choice, though, whether or not I really do love the person. 

I am bound to contradict myself, it is inevitable. This is part of realizing mistakes. Some beliefs outweigh others, though, and it is easy for me to see that compassion really does overrule nearly all the others. 

I think I am pushing for her independence as a thinking person. In most scenarios I deliberately do not give her help in the way that she expects, with the hopes that she might learn to create it on her own. In some sense, what I have just typed does seem quite sinister. In the end, however, I would only want her to feel capable, and independent, courageous, thoughtful, good. But I have a feeling that there is of course some issue with wanting her to be who I want her to be, and I have of course known for a long time that I will never know what exactly she ought to be. This is where it makes a run-in with my philosophies for the video, though. I don't know what I am doing. Anything and everything that I think or do has the potential to be in need of changes. 

Am I busy typing here searching for one perfect answer? No, but I am continuing to think! I want a better answer than what I already have. What I already have seems to be causing some problems and I am trying my best to understand the depth and breadth of these issues and what changes need to be made. This is very hard. Hard because I am confident that a positive change can be made in my beliefs and behaviors for the better. 

Do I need to be paying more attention to Lisa's love languages? Maybe I should not be so quick to write off the concepts. I am in a state of self-correction. I have no problem with this, but what if I am in a relationship with someone who has not yet figured out to self-improve? Perhaps she, in her uncertainty about what to do on her end, focuses on the things that she finds unpleasant in me and spends her time trying to tell me this. Makes me want to ask her when was the last time she changed her way of thinking. 

Fuck. This is what she has been struggling to learn to do. How to change her mindset. She has told me this. It is making more sense, though I will remain open-minded in admission of my own inevitable ignorance.

How to change one's mindset. Way of thinking. Beliefs. How to revise your beliefs. Self-help is belief revision. The map that you have been following has not led you to the right place, so we need to change your map. But you are the only one who has access to your map. 

There are all of these technical examples that I have of a self-correcting system. How to integrate that with more fluff talk, or to do it at all? First off it seems that the idea of a belief map is central to talking about this problem. In physics terms for a self-righting nonlinear system, it is simply a set of mathematical rules. By following a set of rules, we can become self-equilibrating systems. Now it is about remembering and holding our selves to our certain set of rules. Our core beliefs. This requires that we be conscious of our rules and observant of what is guiding us to where we are. If we do not know all of the hidden beliefs that are guiding us then we will not know what to edit. 

Know yourself. Meditate. Write to yourself, talk to yourself. Understand what makes you tick. The patterns in your behavior. Understand the beliefs that you hold, consciously and subconsciously, so you may identify what needs to be changed. 

Okay so now say that we have identified what rule needs to be changed, or at least one rule that we suspect is causing problems, how do we make a reasonable change?

Should have ended the conversation sooner, telling Lisa to talk with herself and get to know what she really thinks. That can help her side of things, and is in my opinion perhaps the only way for her to help her side of things. Of course there is the possibility that I will be in need of doing the most changing. So then the duty is for us to understand all of the data points of the problem and then go away from each other to think for ourselves. Definitely NOT to try and fix someone else's behavior before they make up their own mind about themselves, themselves. Okay. This was apparently a mistake that I have made just minutes ago. 

Self-help is about believing in the ability to change one's beliefs. I mean this in the sense of the snake that eats its own tail. Similar to knowing that one knows nothing. Perhaps instead, believing that beliefs change.

Now, could people believe that maybe everything that they feel is being felt for a reason? As in, it is justified? This would be the opposite of the kind of humility that I have typed about. Epistemic arrogance. And then to epistemic servility, the notion that there is no adequate justification for any of my feelings. I think that if there is or isn't an adequate justification, I will never really know it.


After identifying what might need changing, how to change it. Well we must consider the hypothetical: consider an individual who's list of beliefs does not include any rule for modifying those beliefs. In his current state, he would be quite the hypocrite to change his ways. He would have to go against what he believes. Perhaps he has not asked himself whether or not beliefs should change, but if he is firm then it seems it would be extremely hard to convince him to be a hypocrite. 

Hypocrisy is important. Perhaps in the way I mean it, being inconsistent is a better phrase to use. Do you believe that beliefs can change? That your beliefs can change? 

You are feeling bad because your beliefs about the world are probably wrong. Something happened that you did not expect, or anticipate. Your belief map was inaccurate, so you got lost. Predictability.         

- Beliefs change and adapt over time.

Your unhappiness will not last. Your happiness will also not last. Balance between credulity and skepticism. The shape of your brain got you to where you are right now. And the shape of your brain changes with every second that passes. You have every reason to believe that the shape of your brain will create a different experience for you shortly in the future. Now where does the sense of agency come from?

I think that one of the worst things to hear some one say, can be the words "I don't know..." in despair. Makes me want to ask, are you sure you don't know? You seem to be quite sure that you don't know, therefore you know something. 

The one thing that you hold onto has called for the dismantling of everything you held before. I don't know that I don't know. What do you believe in? I don't know... Okay so you believe that you don't know what you believe. Yes. There's a belief! You have a belief! It was that easy! So your one belief is that you don't know what you believe. 

You don't know. And you don't have to know. No one is asking you to know.

I am going to make a video about self help. Ironic how the category of self-help, you have people paying for advice from other people, and not themselves. It's like a snake biting it's own tail. Given that this subject is susceptible to woo, I will take a more technical approach into the general nature of self-correction. 

Self-correction. Machine learning. Nonlinear dynamics, the swarmalator, recursive mapping, finding equilibrium. Resilience. Feedback loops, Romeo and Juliet. Depends on the rules. But with a certain set of rules, even under huge changes in the environment systems can always make their way back to stability. Some variations of the rules can send systems to eternal chaos, unpredictability. 

We tend to make rules for ourselves. We have beliefs, subconscious and conscious that guide us in our actions. And so we are acting on our beliefs and seeing the results of these actions and based on those results we can decide how well those beliefs served us in our goals, and so we revise them. It is a constant feedback look of experiencing our own actions and then using our beliefs/rules to act on the effects of our actions. The key is to keep testing and changing those rules to fine-tune the character of your experience. 

It can be tuned toward whatever you want. Maximum pleasure, or truth approaching, maximum attention, etc. What do you want? I want to find out what I want. Perhaps. 

But this means that in the rules of conduct, there must be a rule that changes according to the conduct. The response induces a response in the system. Respond to your own actions. Be Self aware. Know yourself as best as you can. Mathematically, this couples each output to the output to come. This is literally what enables a system to become self-corrective, it's sensitivity to its own output/products/actions. 

- Know Yourself

But this is, in this view, a continuous endeavor. The instant that a system claims to "know itself" and stop trying to self-analyze, it becomes linear and subject to whatever perturbation comes along. Know is meant, then, not as a goal but an activity. To observe yourself, and to do so intensely. Self-awareness is key.

- Observe* Yourself

Now is where chaos can occur, when the coupling takes on certain higher values. 

!! Need to try the swarmalator sim where swarmalators don't all have the same coupling parameter values.

** 04:10

I have been absolutely mesmerized by the swarmalator simulation having set up scenarios with each half of the swarm in different phases. So many interesting patterns arise that I am curious to know if Strogatz has already looked into or would find interesting. I have so many questions and theories to test that I might save this for a future video idea. 

Two key concepts so far. Beliefs change and adapt over time, and really paying attention to yourself can heighten your ability to be self-corrective. Think about what you did and what came of it.

So I seem to have established that it is important to let beliefs change, but in what way? What does "Truth" look like in the swarmalators? 

Perhaps ... There are rules that govern your actions, known or unknown to you, they are within your brain. If you don't like where your actions have led you, you must make it a priority to discover what these rules are within yourself. Then change the rules. Experiment. Test. Predict. Make educated guesses.

That was very preachy. There are always more questions. I want to point to still be that this is not actually a self-help channel. Its a self-improvement channel. It puts butterflies in my stomach how amazed I am by the swarmalator concept and how it gives hints into other aspects of life.

Key to the first point I think is not to think that you only need help changing your environment. Whether we try to make it happen or not, our beliefs can and will change. We are imperfect, our memory fails, we forget our resolutions, the people around us rub off on us. And I think that it is especially important to emphasize that this can extend to all beliefs, especially those most core to who we are.

While it can be a mark of spinelessness to change your mind with every change in the wind, the willingness to change even the core of your mindset can also make you incredibly resilient, adaptable, and in that respect, mentally durable.

I haven't even brought up how one might care what other people think about their actions, but that is ultimately part of one's own experience and can be grouped in to the observation of the self, but in this case an observation of how one reacts to the opinions of others.  

The main message might be along the lines of me saying that I don't know what's right. Anything that I believe is something that I, an imperfect human being, believes, and could therefore be misguided or frankly, wrong. I then must say that I honestly do not know what I should do. So then I definitely do not know what anyone else should do, and I will not pretend to.

Thinking about how to start and end the video. Also just noticed that I was sitting and thinking for a bit and didn't think to type, though now I am thinking that it would have been much better thought out here. I have the mind map but no clear direction going through it. 

Self-help for the hard thinker, some title like that. Something to get people interested and hopeful for a non-woo video.

The end will include some version of the message, this isn't a self-help channel. Kind of. Its for myself. To help me remember all my adventures. A way for me to observe myself and make revisions. Share what I have learned, and how I have changed, hopefully for the better.


** 06:11 

Not wanting to type much. My lack of sleep seems to be catching up with me. Haven't come up with a sequence for the video but I definitely have enough concepts to work with. 

Thinking about how the channel will age, I seem to want the main message of the first video to be something like I decided to try something new and make a channel with an evolving title. Just like the idea that everything I know could be wrong, and might need revision somewhere down the road, the EVO will stand for the recursive belief in revising beliefs, the only permanent part, and the rest will build on as the channel progresses. Something like this. Hopefully I wont present it in some seemingly profound philosophical moment, but perhaps as more modest. That would be cool. 

Might want to go back and make sure I cut down on the possible woo. Just want to leave in the inspiring science and perhaps just let people draw the conclusions for themselves. Again, if this really is for me then I should just post what I believe is meaningful. That will be the desired route for sure. With such a self-descriptive message, though, it actually seems feasible to include some potentially outlandish beliefs, so long as they are identified as my own, possibly from when I was younger, where the evolutionary nature of the channel might inspire others to pursue whatever they believe. Inspire others, but really convey the importance of being courageous. Ya know, the study hard what interests you most quote. Irreverently and what not.

Hopefully I am not going to far in the credulous direction with this whole endeavor, talking about changing my own mind and stuff. I haven't mentioned the question everything concept in here at all either. I wonder if it will come up with a place for it.

Getting close to sunrise. Head is aching from lack of sleep and the energy drink and adderall. Would be quite depressing if this whole thing just seemed like a load of fluffy nonsense when I wake up. Gotta say that the ideas were very intensely inspiring earlier though, even before I had taken the adderall I had decided to pull the all nighter. Must've had some thoughts coming together at the time. Always a different experience being up for this long. State of my brain is definitely different than usual, at least in the physical senses.

Making a lot of journal entries today. Slept for about 4-5 hours and then watched some YouTube and talked with Lisa again. Everything seems to be going well today. I didn't want to sit and write here like this again. My first instinct is always to come up with excuses for not doing it. Today it was that I had already typed so much the night before. Just had the thought of keeping my laptop open some place where I can just
