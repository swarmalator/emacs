If I erase the customization and then set the ispell-program-name variable to hunspell outside of the customize interface then it works just fine. I could code this process in as a macro but I am not sure that is the most efficient way to fix it. Kind of annoying. 

Was just texting Markus about how meaningless the gratification in video games is. Some might say it is good to let the brain relax, and thus justifying some playing of video games. I am not so sure because the very nature of game developing is to produce the most appealing thing to spend your time on. Corporate influence seems to select for the products which are able to produce the most profit. From the point of view of the company, it is understandable that in order to survive, one must make a profit. But to be the biggest company and monopolize over all the others is perhaps not the best way to further the society as a whole, just the corporation. Makes sense why there has been big business anti-trust legislation in the past. Hopefully I am remembering those terms correctly from school. 

Oh yeah, I did that thing where I wrote down that whole video idea. I wonder what I will end up doing with that. I want to make a video, the thought of having something up on the web for people to see is exciting, though also nerve racking. Why in the world should it be nerve-racking though? Am I in fear of judgment? Afraid of being cast out by my fellow humans, afraid of being alone? If anything, putting my ideas out there for people to hear should make me less alone, as there would then be more people who have some understanding of my thoughts. Albeit probably not a whole understanding, but definitely more than would be if I would not post a video. 

Maybe I should test the quality of my current cameras and microphones. Take a couple videos and make some music with the guitar and do some voiceover, just to see what options I have and how a video might turn out. 

This is gay. But it is not really I don't know.

Markus helped me get woke. I have black boogers I wonder why. Probably from mowing and kicking up dust. Now if I want to be motivated and be a better person and all this shit and I want to keep other people around me doing that too. I think it has to show that I am doing that too and that I am changing. Maybe the best way to get other people to change is to show change happening in yourself. Honestly, of course. Real change.

Think I am going to trim some trees in the pasture behind the backyard. With the pole saw. Had the thought that if I think of something to do, instead of writing it off and tending to say "I'll do that later" I can just think of something to do about it, however pointless or small, just doing /some/ thing as opposed to nothing.

Found a cool way to listen to music on my headphones using the wireless capability. Connected my phone to my echo via bluetooth and then used an aux cord to connect the echo to my wireless dongle which is plugged into usb power. Purty cool or probably just mildly interesting. 

Deciding that I would like to get up at 5. Had the thought earlier today that it might be useful to get up before the sunrise and get all of my morning browsing out of the way and then get up from bed with the sun, since I really seem to like using my phone in bed in the morning.

Listening to carpenter brut. Sounds like great music for when I want to get something done. Might not be the best for when I need to think about what to do in the first place.

This sounds really good. I want to tell Markus about this stuff that I have been doing because I really don't tell anyone. Not even Lisa, heh. Was just on the phone with her and ended up ending the conversation. I told her that she was talking more than she was listening, but less direct than saying just that. I did tell the truth in that the conversation didn't seem that fun for me. Seemed like she was working really heard to seem like she was listening and paying attention to what I was saying, so maybe I shouldn't have given up on that, but it is mildly depressing to seemingly discover that my girlfriend is more interested in saying what she thinks than asking what I do. 

I feel like there are so many things that I have thought about that Lisa would want to know about. I am not sure if it is my fault for not telling her or my reacting to her level of interest in me. I certainly don't want to be so self-absorbed as to tell her all the things I am thinking and not leave time to listen to her. Ah, if she read this she would have probably related herself to the last sentence.  


There are so many things to do I can't be going to bed just yet I was just getting started here! Something I imagine someone saying if they had awoken and experienced their first day as a human adult thinking about the idea of having to go to sleep. This music makes that thought sound quite beautiful.

What if I make a mix tape for people that I care about. I did that for Isaac and it was quite meaningful. Should I make the music myself? Probably not, unless I discover I can actually write decent music. I haven't tried this recently, though I have been not terrible at it in the past. This song that is playing is great. I like listening to musing music.

Didn't really take videos like I thought about doing earlier. I was talking to Markus right as I thought of that though. Might have had something important to think about that kind of got in the way of that. Maybe I can download that software now.

Finishing the package updates for Manjaro. What else. Getting up at 5 am means probably going to bed at 9 - little late for that. 7 hours of sleep isn't that bad though. I put my ps4 away earlier today. I want to have a project going, and I think that this YouTube video is a good thing to start with. What else could I be doing for the project? Getting music situated, I guess. Hopefully I don't need to have that app to record from my guitar with the pickup that my dad got me.
