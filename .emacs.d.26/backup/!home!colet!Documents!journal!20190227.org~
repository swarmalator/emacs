Feel lazy. What did my day look like. Looked like a day! Search your feelings, Luke.

Watched videos on masculinity this morning. They were great videos, made me think about myself in a different way. May have challenged my way of thinking a bit. Arch Linux didn't download over night so I continued the download once I got up and after an hour or so I got my laptop to boot it up from a USB stick.

Soon after, my Mom texted me asking if there were any sprouts in the garden, to which I replied no, only to realize upon inspection that there were in fact three onion sprouts coming up in the garden.
