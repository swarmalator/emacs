There is no footage of the ISS being constructed. People have a right to say these things. Moon landing deniers, maybe we went maybe we didn't. I have a right to question. These are all quotes from the Alex Jones podcast by the way. He bets his life that we went to the moon. I know the real NASA person. 

Ran the lasers on the moon. This is not drama, the former NORAD command base. Presidential letters to his house. Black Ops in Cambodia. You're right that there were missions beforehand. Men were willing to die. That's what pisses me off. Blew up on the launchpad. Faked the footage. The footage was bullshit but you actually went to the moon. The Van Allen belts. Notice how the international flights are at night. Solar radiation. Imagine the atmosphere is a lens. Why is the sun red? Looking through more atmophere than when it is straight up.

I think Jones is wrong about the reasoning behind why the moon is red/orange when it rises.
