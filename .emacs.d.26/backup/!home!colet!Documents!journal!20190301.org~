I think I should make a mind map every time I do a journal. Maybe there is a good way to think about structuring them. Do I just write first and then recap with the mind map? Should questions appear on the mind map? Maybe as a different color. Do I want the arrows to point chronologically? Might be cool to see some chronological orders and also the topical connections.

I'm not sure how to keep the structure going as I write, maybe it should be after I am done writing? After each sentence?

Over time what could I do with all of the mind maps. I could make a larger map and include all of them where they connect. Would be hard to make all of the connections, perhaps just where the same words are used. Would end up being a giant mess, though. Maybe the frequency with which each concept is referenced will affect the size of that item. That would be cool, I don't know what it would look like though, or if it would provide any insight. 

Also thinking it would be nice to be able to type after the mind map here.     

I just put it in a different file, same as this one but with "_map" added to the name. Also an org file.

Would I be able to construct a literate version of a mind map? Possibly without having to go back and re-read the whole thing.. ?
