*** Mind map
I think I should make a mind map every time I do a journal. Maybe there is a good way to think about structuring them. Do I just write first and then recap with the mind map? Should questions appear on the mind map? Maybe as a different color. Do I want the arrows to point chronologically? Might be cool to see some chronological orders and also the topical connections.
**** Structure
I'm not sure how to keep the structure going as I write, maybe it should be after I am done writing? After each sentence?
***** Literate
Would I be able to construct a literate version of a mind map? Possibly without having to go back and re-read the whole thing.. ?
**** Text
Also thinking it would be nice to be able to type after the mind map here. I just put it in a different file, same as this one but with "_map" added to the name. Also an org file.
*** Meta mind map
Over time what could I do with all of the mind maps. I could make a larger map and include all of them where they connect. Would be hard to make all of the connections, perhaps just where the same words are used. Would end up being a giant mess, though. Maybe the frequency with which each concept is referenced will affect the size of that item. That would be cool, I don't know what it would look like though, or if it would provide any insight.

*** Asking for help
Just got off the phone with Lisa, and when things got a bit difficult I ended up thinking to ask her if she wanted my help. She at first said that she didn't think I could help, but that she wanted it. Then answered no, so we hung up, then she called back minutes later and answered yes. Seems to have been a pivotal question to ask someone. I paced around the house saying it again to myself in disbelief "Do you want my help?" said in the best of ways, of course.

**** Vulnerability
Vulnerability was also one of the final topics and I discussed how I wanted to learn what it means to be vulnerable. Made me think of things I have heard about the fact that it takes courage to ask someone for help. Could also be very demeaning to ask someone if they want your help, now that I think about it.. Definitely want to think more about this.

***** Do the hard thing
I read the white board as I paced around as well and realized that I had come to thinking the phrase "do the hard thing" the other night. Possibly after I had made a decision about playing video games, and tried to extend the event into a lesson for the rest of my life. Also want to think more about this topic as well.

*** Reciprocity
Was just thinking again about[[Vulnerability][ vulnerability]] and how sometimes a person will not admit their fallibility until someone else has also agreed to acknowledge some undisclosed imperfection. Maybe there is a fear of one-sided vulnerability. 

**** School of Life

***** Manipulation
Watched the School of Life video on [[Vulnerability][vulnerability]] as well and they discussed the dark side of vulnerability, when someone would crazily ask someone for help with their deepest problems. Going to someone saying that they need help from committing suicide as a way to manipulate the actions of others, perhaps. 

****** Total Openness
But more and more I think that there might be a way to live in complete vulnerability to others and be truly happy, or at least flourish in some way. If this is true, I feel like I still have a lot more to learn to get there.

******* Authenticity
How does one communicate [[Vulnerability]] without the threat of trying to manipulate people into helping or divulging information? I think it just has to be genuine.

******** Reason

********* Fallibility

********** Self-correction

*********** Awareness via others
I really do want to know how I can be more vulnerable, I think I have thought in ways that danced around the idea of it without ever saying the word. I have said I want to be open to other people so that I can make sure that I am not going crazy and that I can revise my ideas if necessary. But I don't want to be open to other people solely for the purpose of getting them to change their minds to think like me.

************ Agnosticism
I genuinely do not know what the hell is going on in people minds or lives. I could not possibly know what is best for anyone, let alone what's best for me to say to anyone. 

[[Reciprocity]]
Maybe the only way to help someone is to convince them that you need help too. I don't think this explains nearly anything though, because things often seem to be much harder than they appear in times of clarity such as this. 

************* Lying
[[Authenticity]]
I think it comes down to lying, and trust. Knowing whether or not someone is actually being honest and vulnerable for [[Reason][logical reasons]], or if there is some form of deception going on. 

************** Misunderstanding
In reality, though, there will always be some form of deception in that [[Fallibility][people]] are on always, on some level, misunderstood. 

*************** Myself
I want to say, then, that I am [[Vulnerability][vulnerable]] because I am [[Fallibility][imperfect]] and [[Agnosticism][do not know]] the answers. I will not [[Lying][pretend]] to know the answers and instead I will tell people that I precisely am capable, in any case, of [[Misunderstanding][being mistaken]]. If I am wrong, I want to know if I am so I can [[Self-correction][make a change]], and so I want to know what [[Awareness via others][your take]] on my situation is in case I can learn something from your perspective.
