I got the tripod out from the shed. Don't feel like mind mapping this journal entry at the moment. Probably better for organizing thoughts about a particular project or conversation, not just random thoughts. 

Really happy with the setup I figured out with my steelseries wireless headset and the amazon echo. Can control volume level from my watch too, when the headset isn't on and it's playing through the speakers. 

Since I have the tripod out and figured how to use it, what kind of video would I want to make. I thought of making three body collision problem and putting it on YouTube, modeled after the research that Dr. Miller did. Specifically how the mathematics of the three gravitational planes is the same as the billiard bouncing in a wedge.

I think I want to get back into capturing a TODO list with org and dropbox. Or at least just to keep a list of my interests. I really liked the setup that I used to have and it is painful for me to realize right now that I do not know really why I stopped. Perhaps I got comfortable in being lazy out here or something. Darn.
