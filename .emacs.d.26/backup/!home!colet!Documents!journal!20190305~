Now is that time again when I decide which To-do keywords I want to use. Right now it is just Todo and done. 


** 20:12 
Just spent some time trying to fix the ispell/flyspell issue and did not succeed. Looked online and did not find anyone who had the same issue. If I had to guess I would say that either Emacs or hunspell is too recent of a version to be running together. Something in the API for hunspell probably changed or something. It's not such a huge thing so I can look into this later and just watch my words so I don't make so many mistakes.

Currently downloading Rocket League for Steam. Was going to really just look at the TODO keywords. Darn, I got distracted into focusing on the ispell issue. Would have been worth it if I fixed it, though. 

Okay so TODO and DONE. Seems like I might want to use a mind map for this? Well I will just keep writing for now. Just having TODO and DONE always seemed a bit too reductionist for me because there are some things that I would want to remember to look into /sometime/, but not at any particular time. An interesting subject that I would want to learn more about, like studying the space-time diagrams and stuff in the first chapter of the book Dr. Kattawar gave me.

And looking into things never really seems to end, so it's hard so say that I am DONE looking into something. But what if I just spent time on it and then based on how much time is spent on it move it lower down on the list? Make way for the interests that I have and haven't spent time on.

I used to have the SEE, PLAN, DO, DONE cycle, if I am remembering it correctly. Or sometimes I would use the LOOK keyword. I remember also using NOTE as a keyword. 

Basically, I want to remember the things that I need to get done as well as the things that I would be interested in learning. Ideally, the things that strike the most interest would be at the top of the list, but I guess that would be hard to quantify for an organized list of interests. 

I am imagining an org file of interest as headlines of the same level, where I will open it and edit the order of the interests as I look into them. As one begins to take more of my time than the others, I can move some up and others down. Like a continually evolving top 10 list of interests or something.

Now I am imagining that this list of top interests would probably lead to certain topics morphing into others, or when I research something further it becomes clearer what is so interesting about it, and I have then discovered a different topic of interest. Or maybe there is a subset of interests that are not as researchable, and these are my values. For example, I got into farming and woodworking and craftsmanship and things, ultimately leading to my thoughts on what it means to do honest work. And so the values of honesty and humility would have come from exploring those interests. Now, those are definitely interesting topics still, woodworking and such, so I don't think they would get booted from the list after that value judgement.

Seems like a good idea to have a list of the subjects that interest me. For example, Nanotechnology or Science YouTubers or something more tangible and researchable. Not philosophical or moral interests like humility, though.

Might be a great idea to have a system that reminds you what you are interested in, obviously up for revision at all times. Seems to be a separate thing from the TODO/DONE business. 

Separate org files for each topic of interest? I don't think so as titles will likely change. Maybe just an interest.org file with each interest as a different heading. Would this be able to be integrated into agenda?

I am wanting to separate my more intellectual or research-type interests from my hobby-like interests. Gardening and category theory, for example. One has to do with something that I am already doing, and the other is something that I am interested in potentially doing. But then Emacs productivity is a topic that I am actively working on and am also very interested in researching. There is not much research I think to be done on it, though.

I could always make further distinctions, but would it be worth it to distinguish between new interests and strong interests? Or a way to position them on scales of both respects, perhaps? Because if I stumble into some topic that I know nothing about but am very interested in initially, like I was with styropyro's YouTube channel, I wouldn't want to put that in the same category as functional programming, which I have been interested in for almost a year, for example.

This makes me want to add a "NEW" keyword to the TODO list, perhaps not in a sequence with those other ones, just by itself. And this begs the question, what about old interests? Nonlinear dynamics? Would I want to make a separate archive of old subtrees from the interest file? Would'nt be a bad idea, I suppose. Do I want to mark them as old, though? 

Had a cool thought to maybe keep track of all the changes to my interest file via git. Then I can see when things are added and subtracted by the date. Not sure if there is a way to visualize the additions over time, but that would definitely be the coolest thing holy crap. I want to develop a program that would keep track of these things. Might require a lot of input from the user but dang, this is a cool idea. Makes me want to keep track of the ideas I get for stuff. 

An IDEA keyword! Just thought of it, maybe it will work? Or maybe it would be better as a tag and not as a keyword. 

Still not sure what to do about old things, like old hobbies. I might want to revisit them, so I don't want to just delete them. Archiving seems to be a good idea. Marking them as OLD? Keeping track of the time that they are captured? Or the time that they were edited, considered, entertained?

Seems like all this theorizing about keeping track of things is ultimately dependent on my ability to self-reflect and maintain whatever system I put in place. Would want to make sure the system requires as little as possible from me, the user. I want to keep track of what I spend my time on, though. That could have a bit to do with the hobby section. One of my hobbies, one might say, is to surf the web.

Bumping is really what I need to be doing in these files. Whenever I spend time on one of these, I simply bump it to the top of the list to remind myself what I have been interested in, working on, etc. Now it makes sense to have separate files for each of the categories, ideas, interests, hobbies.

I think I have a system in place now. Org files hobbies, youtube, projects, and research. I wish there was a quicker way to bump the things that I do, though. Heres an idea for the evolving mind map. Make an app that contains all the things that you spend a moderate to large amount of time on. Every time that you find yourself spending time doing that thing, simply open the app and click on that subject in a list and it will be bumped to the top. Keeps track of when you bump things as well as organize them in a mind map. Hm this is a great idea. See, this is when I would want to bump the mind map thing right now. I could start by writing a lisp program that does this. OOOOOOOOHOOHOHOHO I am excited for this. Maybe I should write it tonight??

What data would need to be stored? The name of the topics/activities, each with a list of the date/times that they get bumped.

What kind of visualization would we want to come out of it?

Just spent some time searching to see if a "bump" tracking app like I am imagining exists, and could not find one. Some were tallying, or keep track of the time since certain things, but I am looking for a habit bumper. All of those things could be implemented by a bumper app, at least in the way that I am imagining it. I want to add this to my ideas. 

Still couldn't find an app that does what I want. Man, I am thinking about how valuable it is to be able to write your own apps. Pisses me off how you have to pay for developer license for apple. Deliberately not customizable. Proprietary software, designed to make money. Fuck it pisses me off so bad.

Just imported all of my old journal entries that I still had in my backups folder. I wonder if I actually wrote any others before that. If I had, I didn't put it in a journal folder. I might have to sift through my backups later. Might be some good stuff there. Lots of it is probably on the dropbox right now which I should download once Rocket League finishes downloading. 

*** TODO Dropbox download
