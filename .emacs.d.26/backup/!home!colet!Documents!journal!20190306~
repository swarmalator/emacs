Some weird thing happens with the journal file when I create a new entry. Does this want to be indented or not? Spell checking isn't working either, which is a must for Emacs to be presentable to other people. I shouldn't lie if I am to make a video about it, it is not for the faint of heart, and it does not always work instantly. That is the beauty of it though, it takes some fiddling to get used to it.

Ohh, I see thats why the indent was only on the first line when indent mode was off, the whole paragraph is one line so the line wrap was coming back to the left side. 

What am I going to do while Rocket League downloads. Do I need to rethink my decision to buy and download it? Well it would be quite the act to stop and delete the download after it has been going for more than 24 hours. I have an hour and a half until it will be downloaded all the way, I think. Says that there are about three hours left but once the new data kicks in it should be much faster.

Thanks for your payment of $665. That's what the verizon app said, I assume my dad paid that. For some reason that strikes me as disgusting that they would thank someone for paying. It might not actually be disgusting, though. I made that charge worse by adding $315 in the replacement phone fee. Shouldn't have even happened. I hope to settle that with my parents in an even way. Maybe I can trade my phone in for another older phone hopefully on an earlier software. I think this probably won't happen though.

I think I am going to get out my Dad's martin guitar. The d string broke on the classical guitar while it was on the stand.
