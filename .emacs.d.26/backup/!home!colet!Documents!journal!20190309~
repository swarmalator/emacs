It is warm today. First time in a while that I am running the AC units. Was thinking about going to Austin today but am having second thoughts as there is a lot of trash to burn and a mess to clean up in the bedroom.

Don't do anything until you think it through here. Maybe that's what I should say. Should I read old journals? They aren't very readable, in my opinion. Maybe I could spend time thinking about ways to make them more readable.
