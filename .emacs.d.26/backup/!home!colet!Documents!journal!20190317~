PJ what are you doing. What am I doing. Didn't want to write. Type. Didn't want to write. Type didnt want to but I am typing and not spell checked and I am leaning back in my chair with my head back and my mouth open. OOF. Not good? Not self aware. Not wanting to be self-aware, just lazy. Ate food after helping move lots of stuff. Then ate and feel like not doing anything.  Taking a nap maybe. Should I go for a run?
