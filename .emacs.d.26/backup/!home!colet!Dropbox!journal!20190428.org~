** 16:12 
This is the dropbox journal. It should update every time I save the file.

In the TWU library with Lisa, I haven't been here in a while. Feel like I have significantly less to work on. Maybe I should be in graduate school. Easier to think that it wouldn't be worth it. Oh I just realized that she could totally pull up the journal folder and see what I have been writing right now.

** TODO This is a todo that might show up in BEorg
