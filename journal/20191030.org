** DONE Program one DSA
** 08:01
Thinking about what to work on. Need to ask Erik what PLL I can program. I could also work on just adding more of the parts that aren't on the pi yet. Lots of parallel IO parts. Also could think about the cascade program and the foundations of it. Might want to do that on my own time though.

I need to repackage this bad SD card soon. To do that I need to open up a good one. Could just go ahead and build another pi. Also need to organize my desk.

** DONE Organize desk

** 08:12
Which one am I going to do? Do I have any other stuff to work on?


** 15:11
Why can't N be zero in a PLL/VCO? Why does the 4/5 or 8/9 prescaler limit the minimum value of N to 23 or 75?  

** DONE Program one PLL
** DONE Add DSAs to ProgramIt
