** DONE Add a part to cascade
** DONE Edit XM-A7X4 from 0804 to 0604

** 18:14
Head hurts from all the stuff I am thinking about. There are a lot of things to do here. Labelmaker could be faster. Information from quickbooks. 
** DONE Finish Airgap Proposal
** 18:58
Just worked on the airgap proposal a bit. Not done with it. Need to get the total. Lisa called. I can go home and work on some of this stuff. Might as well go now. What else might I need to wrap up? What to add to the list? I can remind Erik to change the timer on the filemaker logout.
