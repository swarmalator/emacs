** IT meeting with Carson
*** Initial questions 
- AWS unknowns?
- vLAN map/verify
- UPS login?
- vSphere HA replication
- Switch/patch panel labels
- GENESYS walkthrough
  - Simulator/x-parameters
  - Sys parameter model
  - GENESYS library
- [[https://www.minicircuits.com/WebStore/x_mwblock.html][minicircuits]] web-API (searchAPI)
- extra server ideas?
- Where did we get SSL cert? How is it renewed?

*** 12:32 - S3 buckets
- cf-templates X
- elasticbeanstalk X
- cjk-cascade-test X
- kops-xmicrowave-store X
- pki.xmicrowave.com KEEP
- prod-kops X
- x-microwave.com KEEP
- x-microwave.net KEEP
- xm-codedeploy X
- datapipeline KEEP
- elb logs KEEP
- raspi image X?
- serverless deploy stuff ??

*** 13:19 - CASCADE DB
- deploy.sh - *CI/CD* instance
- DockerFile
  - alpine Linux, layered cache
  - creates docker container on CI/CD instance
  - CI/CD uploads on gitlab
  - =.gitlab-ci.yml= how it's deployed
    - then =deploy.sh=
      - kills docker container
      - removes it
      - manage secret variables 
      - replace and run
      - traefik: port router within docker
      - network web: docker vLan equiv
    - /Portainer is just a convenient human tool/

*** 13:53 Gitlab runner
- CI/CD machine

*** 14:01 Genesys
1. add-part json
2. job queue, translate json to automation (mouse/click sequence)
3. genesys runner

- integrate genesys in with cascade and filemaker info

*** 14:05 Simulator
- generated genesys XML library
- json data in mongoDB
- reverse proxy is similar to traefik
- converted json to genesys XML in simulator
- REDIS is used as the queue server by javascript in simulator
- /Genesys XML format help - reach out to Carson/
  - filemaker genesys file scripts are documented, read those
- Genesys packager
  - update library from the website

*** 14:28 Sys parameters
- cross between X params and S-params
- look for genesys "import/export sys parameters" on filemaker

*** 14:37 minicircuits web api
- SearchApi internally uses filemaker "SearchTool"
- minicircuits emulates older search api
- see "proto buf"

- filemaker -> mer file (basically csv) -> main.rs w/ serde library -> rustoso tool

*** 14:47 Networking
- See networking in the wiki
- CIDR networking concepts
- pfBlocker Black list
*** 14:55 UPS
- don't rely on automatic shut down stuff currently

*** 14:56 HA cluster
- r610s can't run latest ESXi
- turn r610s into VMware HA SAN server (isczi)?

*** 15:00 Getting new servers 
- Dell servers
- Trend Micro custom built
- Ryzen servers, AMD epic. 
- "whitebox" your own
- deals on craigslist

** 17:56
Okay gears are spinning. I am trying to think about stuff but I guess I am a bit spent after today. Got a lot of useful info from Carson. Tomorrow I want to add more parts to cascade. I want to use that blockbuilder tool, which I can do, but I guess I don't know if it is more important to just add more parts first or to fix the lines on existing parts right now. I think the best thing to do is to just add new parts.
