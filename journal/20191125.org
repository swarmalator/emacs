Going to write down what I did the other day to get an SSL certificate for the internal website.

1. sudo apt install certbot
2. sudo certbot -d xmicrowave.net --manual --preferred-challenges dns certonly
3. create the _acme.challenge TXT record on GoDaddy website
4. press enter to finish the certbot command

another thing I wrote down once was the global vars for the pi program. =global_vars= and also =__slots__=, "dunder" slots, and this is useful on the ReplShell.

** 10:21
Another note on how to get the programit development setup, I wrote:
- pip uninstall pygame kivy
- apt-get update
- apt-get install python-kivy

Basically means to install kivy from the package manager and not through pip. Might need to specify a version too. 1.9.1?
