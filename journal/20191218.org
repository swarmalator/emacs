I am here at the office. Duh. What can I do today. Isaac is coming today. He is not here early like he usually is, though. Let's check on that PLL.

Lets make a list of things to do on cascade. Isaac will for sure be able to help me do this.

To sync the PCB SVG files to cascade, I am running the following command in the Website Assets folder:
#+begin_src 
cole@colexml:/run/user/1000/gvfs/smb-share:server=warehouse14.local,share=e_drive/Website_Assets/PCB Images SVG$
aws s3 sync . s3://xmicro-assets/cascade/svg/brd/
#+end_src
