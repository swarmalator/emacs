Chilling in the office by myself. Isaac just left and I almost left with him. He leaves earlier I bet because he needs to drive downtown.I didn't get here early today so I should stay until 5 probably. Claudia said bye. Going to look at the list. FileMaker might be what to work on. I want to make a home server lab. Need to get more familiar with active directory and virtualization. Maybe.

Just talked with John about Genesys stuff. I could try to get my hands on the Genesys tool. Talked about Andrew as well.
