Service specific error: 2148081683

Tried to add the revocation checking back into the certificate services with the following:

certutil â€“setreg ca\CRLFlags -CRLF_REVCHECK_IGNORE_OFFLINE

net stop certsvc
net start certsvc

But I had to add it back because doing this gave me that error. Changed the minus to a plus before CRLF_REVCHECK_IGNORE_OFFLINE.
