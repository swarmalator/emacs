I am working on a explanation of the IT architecture that we want for X-Microwave. Currently trying to see if ADS can be run remotely on the hardware that we currently have. I was looking into SSDs while the ADS files are copying over to the server. Now I am going to try and flesh out the rest of the list.

- Modem
- Router
