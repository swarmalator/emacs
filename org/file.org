This script will allow you to run commands on the X-MW Controller.

In order to do this you need to make sure the command server is enabled
  1. You will need to make sure that you can use SSH
     - on windows you can install an SSH client like PuTTY
     - on Linux/Mac you can use the built in SSH command
  2. connect the X-MW Controller to the same network as your computer via an ethernet cable
  3. find the ip address of the Controller
     - click the Home icon in the top right
       (if you just started the Controller it should already show the Home screen)
     - click the Question icon in the top right
     - if you connected it directly to your computer use the "192.168.10.2"
       otherwise use the other ipv4 address
  3. Login via SSH at that address with username: "pi", password: "raspberry"
     example: "ssh pi@192.168.1.146"
  4. You should see a prompt like this "pi@raspberrypi:~ $"
  5. Edit the X-MW.ini file
     - type "nano ~/.X-MW.ini" and press ENTER
     - go to the line that says "host_cmd = default" and change it to "host_cmd = true"
     - save and exit the file by pressing CTRL+X then "Y" to the "Save modified buffer" prompt
     - then press ENTER when it asks for the filename to save it into
  6. Reboot the controller by typing "sudo reboot" then ENTER

Now the command server is enabled

to use the command server follow these steps
  1. make sure the Controller is connected to the network like in the previous steps
  2. You will need Python 3.5 or later installed on your computer
     (most Mac and Linux systems already have this)
     - on windows you can get Python 3.5 or later by going to "https://python.org/download"
  3. run this script by opening a terminal in the directory where you downloaded the code
     and typing "python ./X_MWcontroller-interactive.py" when the script prompts you for the hostname,
     enter the ip address
     make sure you run this in python 3 (on Linux/Mac the command is "python3") on windows
     you may need to find the python3 executable and run that passing script as an argument
  4. you should now be in an interactive prompt. you can type commands here and press ENTER
     to send them to the Controller.
  5. to see a list of all the commands or to learn how to use the commands type "help"
     - now you type commands

You may also use the python script as a module and import it into other scripts.
the only variable you need to import is class XMWController.
