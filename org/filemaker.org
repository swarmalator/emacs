* WIP [#A] Only put cascade boards in cascade S3 bucket 
Waiting on Erik to put board SVG container in the file manager file just like he does already with pngs.  
* TODO [#B] Add missing FormFactors
* TODO [#B] Remove unnecessary sparams
Remove sparam file names for PLLs, PLL-VCOs and stuff like that. Also make sure that the cascade export doesn't create the "models" entry when there is no sparam.
* TODO [#B] Generate raw HTML parametric tables
* TODO [#B] Limiters missing IL data
* TODO [#B] XM Part registry Error checker
We don't have a way to identify what needs attention in filemaker. Something that can create a TODO list or something.  
* TODO [#B] Improve labelmaker
quickbooks -> sharepoint -> filemaker label thing

Need to ask Kristen: "What do you do when you create labels for spring pin boards"

1. Auto serialize parts
2. Spring pin boards

[2020-02-06 Thu] Also need to get off of the old labelmaker tool and just use filemaker

* WIP [#A] Add more housings to Xcessories and cascade
Check in the HOU Formfactors for supported housings that aren't in the database yet.  
[2020-02-07 Fri]
Worked on creating svgs for new ones a bit today. Very annoying to try to get them to look the way they do already on cascade. Need to figure out if this is even reasonable to keep trying to do - maybe there is a better way or I am not using something in inkscape.

housings are in the folder:   
Production/_SolidWorks_Production_17July18/Erik's Project For Cascade Tool/

and the ones already on cascade are in the hsg
* TODO [#F] Universal Part Formfactors
