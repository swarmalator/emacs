Service specific error: 2148081683

Tried to add the revocation checking back into the certificate services with the following:

certutil â€“setreg ca\CRLFlags -CRLF_REVCHECK_IGNORE_OFFLINE

net stop certsvc
net start certsvc

But I had to add it back because doing this gave me that error. Changed the minus to a plus before CRLF_REVCHECK_IGNORE_OFFLINE.

Tried to configure some old Grandstream phones but I couldn't get them to work. Looked on 3CX and the provisioning seemed to be the same as the other phones. On the phone's display it kept saying that it wasn't configured. Seems like we need to just order some new phones that are the same kind as the others.

Erik's phone is the model GXP2170
